This pool, however, is continually replenished during contraction, as described later, so that even when the muscle fatigues, ATP stores are only modestly decreased. Muscle cells contain creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "with these questions, students received a list of materials available for the experiment. In the classroom, they proposed two protocols of eight 30-m sprints at maximum speed, one protocol with pauses of 120 s and the other protocol with pauses of 20 s between sprints.

Blood uric acid was analyzed before exercise and 15 and 60 min after exercises.

On the other hand, the overall amount of ATP present in his body at any time would probably not exceed 100 g, an energy reserve equivalent to approximately two minutes (a few seconds for the brain). This is because the utilization and recycling of ATP is extremely rapid, and explains the speed at which", "intervals between the high intensity efforts and sprints could play an important role in maintaining performance, such as removing intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) and the resynthesis of phosphocreatine stores (PCr). In addition, when maximum efforts are repeated with short rest intervals, the aerobic contribution increases during the exercise and can be decisive in maintaining high intensity performance (;. Thus, it seems possible that the best performance indices in high intensity intermittent efforts are dependent on aerobic fitness. This could be due to the RAST consisting of forward sprints, without changes of direction, which little resemble efforts in soccer.

Long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria: After a LCFA enters a cell, it is converted in the cytosol to its CoA derivative by long-chain fatty acyl CoA synthetase (thiokinase), an enzyme of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Because \u03b2-oxidation occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, the fatty acid must be transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is impermeable to CoA. Therefore, a specialized carrier transports the long-chain acyl group from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix. This carrier is carnitine, and this rate-limiting transport process is called the carnitine shuttle (Fig. 16.16). a.

During starvation, cells must typically shift from growth to survival mode and alter metabolism towards functions important for viability. Instead of shipping acetyl units out to the cytosol, there is now a greater requirement for acetyl-CoA to be oxidized in the mitochondria for ATP synthesis (Fig. 1). Under such conditions, nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA levels therefore decrease. Fatty acids are a significant source of this mitochondrial acetyl-CoA pool []. CoA synthesis is induced to activate fatty acids as fatty acyl-CoAs], which can then be transported into mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle for \u03b2-oxidation. As a result, acetyl-CoA is generated in the mitochondria for oxidation or other possible fates. In the liver, mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is used to synthesize ketone bodies (acetoacetate and", "binding to the carnitine molecule to form acyl-carnitine. The free fatty acid in the cytosol is attached with a thioester bond to coenzyme A (CoA). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and driven to completion by inorganic pyrophosphatase. The acyl group on CoA can now be transferred to carnitine and the resulting acyl-carnitine transported into the mitochondrial matrix. This occurs via a series of similar steps: - Acyl-CoA is conjugated to carnitine by carnitine acyltransferase I (palmitoyltransferase) located on the outer mitochondrial membrane - Acyl-carnitine is shuttled inside by a carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase - Acyl-carnitine is converted to acyl-CoA by carnitine acyltransferase II (palmitoyltransferase) located on the inner mitochondrial membrane.

It has been speculated that during growth or pregnancy the requirement of carnitine could exceed its natural production. # Role in fatty acid metabolism Carnitine transports long-chain acyl groups from fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, so that they can be broken down through beta-oxidation to acetate to obtain usable energy via the citric acid cycle. In some organisms such as fungi, the acetate is used in the glyoxylate cycle for gluconeogenesis and formation of carbohydrates. Fatty acids must be activated before binding to the carnitine molecule to form acyl-carnitine. The free fatty acid in the cytosol is attached with a thioester bond to coenzyme A (CoA).

During this process, two-carbon molecules acetyl-CoA are repeatedly cleaved from the fatty acid. Acetyl-CoA can then enter the TCA cycle, which produces NADH and FADH. NADH and FADH are subsequently used in the electron transport chain to produce ATP, the energy currency of the cell. # Synthesis # Regulation and control It has long been held that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is the enzyme that hydrolyses triacylglycerides to free fatty acids from fats (lipolysis).

The fatty acid is firstly bound to CoA and may cross the external mitochondrial membrane. It then exchanges the CoA for carnitine by the action of the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. The complex then enters the mitochondrial matrix via facilitated diffusion by carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. Here, the acyl-carnitine complex is disrupted by carnitine palmitoyltransferase II and the fatty acid rebinds to CoA. Carnitine then diffuses back across the membrane by carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This is called the carnitine shuttle system. # Clinical significance A disorder is associated with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase", "the acyl group is transferred from CoA to carnitine by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), an enzyme of the outer mitochondrial membrane.

During its life, an mRNA molecule may also be processed, edited, and transported prior to translation. Eukaryotic mRNA molecules often require extensive processing and transport, while prokaryotic molecules do not. ## Transcription During transcription, RNA polymerase makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. One notable difference, however, is that eukaryotic RNA polymerase associates with mRNA processing enzymes during transcription so that processing can proceed", "where translation occurs. Therefore, unlike bacteria, eukaryotes undergo uncoupled transcription and translation.Eukaryotic gene transcription also involves the recogni-tion and binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter DNA. However, the interaction between the polymerase and DNA is far more complex in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. Because the majority of studies have been focused on the regulation and functions of proteins, this chapter primarily focuses on how protein-encoding mRNA is made by RNA polymerase II.Translation. DNA directs the synthesis of RNA; RNA in turn directs the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are variable-length polypeptide polymers composed of various combinations of 20 different amino acids and are the working molecules of the cell. The process of decoding information on mRNA to synthesize proteins is called translation (see Fig. 15-1). Translation takes place", "Translation at first sight: the influence of leading codons. Numerous controversies are associated with general understanding of factors that slow the ribosome progression along mRNA, such as codons recognized by rare tRNA species, triplets that require wobble decoding, Shine\u2013Dalgarno (SD)-like sites and codons for particular amino acids. Several difficulties hamper identification of coding sequence features that affect the protein production. Computational analysis of mRNA sequences does not allow one to distinguish the cause of particular sequence bias, be it selection towards translation efficiency of particular mRNA, saving resources for the translation of other mRNAs, or other reasons. A direct estimation of natural mRNAs translation efficiencies by riboseq has produced a wealth of data, but restriction of the sampling space by a limited number of genes encoded in a", "polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryote cells the primary transcript (pre-mRNA) is often processed further via alternative splicing. In this process, blocks of mRNA are cut out and rearranged, to produce different arrangements of the original sequence. ## Translation Eventually, this mature mRNA finds its way to a ribosome, where it is translated. In prokaryotic cells, which have no nuclear compartment, the process of transcription and translation may be linked together. In eukaryotic cells, the site of transcription (the cell nucleus) is usually separated from the site of translation (the cytoplasm), so the mRNA must be transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it can be bound by ribosomes. The mRNA is read by the ribosome as triplet codons, usually beginning with an AUG, or initiator", "the same in a given double helix as will the number of G and C residues. In RNA, thymine (T) is replaced by uracil (U), and the deoxyribose is substituted by ribose. Each protein-coding gene is transcribed into a template molecule of the related polymer RNA, known as messenger RNA or mRNA. This in turn is translated on the ribosome into an amino acid chain or polypeptide. The process of translation requires transfer RNAs specific for individual amino acids with the amino acids covalently attached to them, guanosine triphosphate as an energy source, and a number of translation factors. tRNAs have anticodons complementary to the codons in mRNA and can be \"charged\" covalently with amino acids at their 3' terminal CCA ends. Individual tRNAs are charged with specific", "tRNAs to translate a specific sequence of A, C, G, and U nucleotides in an mRNA molecule into a specific sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule occurs on the ribosome, a large multimolecular machine composed of both protein and ribosomal RNA. All of these processes are described in detail in Chapter 6. DNA molecules as a rule are very large, containing the specifications for thousands of proteins. Special sequences in the DNA serve as punctuation, defining where the information for each protein begins and ends. And individual segments of the long DNA sequence are transcribed into separate mRNA molecules, coding for different proteins. Each such DNA segment represents one gene. A complication is that RNA molecules transcribed from the same DNA segment can often be processed", "Determinants of translation efficiency and accuracy. Current points of debate have to do with the relative role of codon choice and mRNA structure in affecting translation, the relative contribution of control at the level of translation initiation versus elongation, the relative extent of selection for efficiency versus accuracy and the role of random drift versus selection in shaping genes sequence. Even further, translation itself constitutes only one of several steps in the gene expression process, and gene expression as a whole poses only part of the constraints that genes' sequences must obey. The same nucleotide should also support other features such as nucleosome positioning, appropriate splicing and higher order structural elements of the DNA. The apparent redundancy of the genetic code hence facilitates a choice between an astronomical", "energy required for translation of proteins is significant. For a protein containing n amino acids, the number of high-energy Phosphate bonds required to translate it is 4n-1. It is also the process whereby ribosomes use the sequence of codons in mRNA to produce a polypeptide with a particular sequence of amino acids. # Translation by hand It is also possible to translate either by hand (for short sequences) or by computer (after first programming one appropriately, see section below), this allows biologists and chemists to draw out the chemical structure of the encoded protein on paper. First, convert each DNA base to its RNA complement (note that the complement of A is now U): Then split the RNA into triplets (groups of three bases). Note that there are", "Translation (biology) Translation is the second process of protein biosynthesis (part of the overall process of gene expression). Translation occurs in the cytoplasm where the ribosomes are located. Ribosomes are made of a small and large subunit which surrounds the mRNA. In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded to produce a specific polypeptide according to the rules specified by the genetic code. This is the process that converts an mRNA sequence into a chain of amino acids that form a protein. Translation is necessarily preceded by transcription. Translation proceeds in four phases: activation, initiation, elongation and termination (all describing the growth of the amino acid chain, or polypeptide that is the product of translation). In activation, the correct amino acid (AA) is joined to the correct transfer RNA", "sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence using the tRNAs as adaptors to add each amino acid in the correct sequence to the growing end of the polypeptide chain. When a stop codon is encountered, the ribosome releases the finished protein, and its two subunits separate again. These subunits can then be used to start the synthesis of another protein on another mRNA molecule. Ribosomes operate with remarkable efficiency: in one second, a eukaryotic ribosome adds 2 amino acids to a polypeptide chain; the ribosomes of bacterial cells operate even faster, at a rate of about 20 amino acids per second.

Sometimes these salts are called acid monohydrates. As a rule, any acid with an ionization constant of 109 or higher may do this. Acids whose ionization constant is below 109 generally cannot form stable H3O+ salts. For example, hydrochloric acid has an ionization constant of 107, and mixtures with water at all proportions are liquid at room temperature. However, perchloric acid has an ionization constant of 1010, and if liquid anhydrous perchloric acid and water are combined in a 1:1 molar ratio, solid hydronium perchlorate forms.

The weak O-H bond causes the acid molecule to be less stable, and causing the hydrogen atom to be labile, thus it dissociates easily to give the H+ ion.

For different parameter values, the system may settle to a unique steady state; or it may behave as a switch, capable of existing in one or another of a set of alternative states; or it may oscillate; or it may show large random fluctuations. Eukaryotic cells, by definition, keep their DNA in a separate membrane-enclosed compartment, the nucleus. They have,", "that all of them can in principle be regulated. Thus a cell can control the proteins it makes by (1) controlling when and how often a given gene is transcribed (transcriptional control), (2) controlling the splicing and processing of RNA transcripts (RNA processing control), (3) selecting which completed mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytosol and determining where in the cytosol they are localized (RNA transport and localization control), (4) selecting which mRNAs in the cytoplasm are translated by ribosomes (translational control), (5) selectively destabilizing certain mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm (mRNA degradation control), or (6) selectively activating, inactivating, degrading, or localizing specific protein molecules after they have been made (protein activity control) (Figure 7\u20135). For most genes, transcriptional controls are paramount. This makes sense because,", "and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm. Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to the these molecules' central role in protein translation; mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation. ## Assembly and disassembly During its lifetime a nucleus may be broken down, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death. During these events, the structural components of the nucleus\u2014the envelope and lamina\u2014are systematically degraded. During the cell", "the questions which we pose are a) the reversibility of the differentiation process; b) the order of steps in the production of specialized messenger RNA; c) the time of shut-off of undifferentiated messenger production; d) the relationship of viral RNA production to the differentiation process; e) the onset and extent of specific protein synthesis; f) the correlation of DNA metabolism with the timing or course of events. By using a computer-controlled cell separator we can select live cells on the basis of their macromolecular content, membrane properties (using a new parameter, fluorescence emission anisotropy), and size (4, 5, 34). Thus with proper probes as described here, we are able to select cells at different stages in their differentiation and can begin to attack the questions posed above.", "control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle. The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes. ## Cell compartmentalization The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In some cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for", "polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryote cells the primary transcript (pre-mRNA) is often processed further via alternative splicing. In this process, blocks of mRNA are cut out and rearranged, to produce different arrangements of the original sequence. ## Translation Eventually, this mature mRNA finds its way to a ribosome, where it is translated. In prokaryotic cells, which have no nuclear compartment, the process of transcription and translation may be linked together. In eukaryotic cells, the site of transcription (the cell nucleus) is usually separated from the site of translation (the cytoplasm), so the mRNA must be transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it can be bound by ribosomes. The mRNA is read by the ribosome as triplet codons, usually beginning with an AUG, or initiator", "descriptive name for the smallest living biological structure was chosen by Robert Hooke in a book he published in 1665 when he compared the cork cells he saw through his microscope to the small rooms monks lived in. # General principles Each cell is at least somewhat self-contained and self-maintaining: it can take in nutrients, convert these nutrients into energy, carry out specialized functions, and reproduce as necessary.

In the past, enzyme reactions were studied exclusively by measuring the generation of products at steady state with a low concentration of enzyme and an excess of substrate.

Before assigning an EC number to a new enzyme, it must first be established that it catalyses a reaction that has not been classified previously.

X. CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "interest and this is especially true if all manner of competition is removed. The ability to combine enzymes isolated from different organisms to function in the same biosynthetic pathway also offers the potential to truly harness all the reactivity nature has to offer. This also obviates the need, for example, to back engineer eukaryotic enzymes for expression in bacterial systems. Further, minimalist approaches allow for rapid detection and identification of bottlenecks and/or degradation pathways. By simplifying the number of components within a system to include only what is required, the ability to identify sources to problems such as slow conversion, incomplete conversion, or off target activity/degradation within a biosynthetic pathway become much easier. A great deal of leeway is also available in how such reactions are implemented with", "Study enzymes STEADY-STATE ENZYME KINETICS Many enzymes have only one substrate, which they bind and then process to produce products according to the scheme outlined in Figure 3\u201350A. In this case, the reaction is written as Here we have assumed that the reverse reaction, in which E + P recombine to form EP and then ES, occurs so rarely that we can ignore it. In this case, EP need not be represented, and we can express the rate of the reaction\u2014known as its velocity, V, as where [ES] is the concentration of the enzyme\u2013substrate complex, and kcat is the turnover number, a rate constant that has a value equal to the number of substrate molecules processed per enzyme molecule each second. But how does the value of [ES]", "enzyme, and the equilibrium point for the reaction will be unchanged (Figure 2\u201323). Thus no matter how much an enzyme speeds up a reaction, it cannot change its direction. Despite the above limitation, enzymes steer all of the reactions in cells through specific reaction paths. This is because enzymes are both highly selective and very precise, usually catalyzing only one particular reaction. In other words, each enzyme selectively lowers the activation energy of only one of the several possible chemical reactions that its bound substrate molecules could undergo. In this way, sets of enzymes can direct each of the many different molecules in a cell along a particular reaction pathway (Figure 2\u201324).

FACTORS AFFECTING REACTION VELOCITY Enzymes can be isolated from cells and their properties studied in a test tube (that is, in vitro). Different enzymes show different responses to changes in substrate concentration, temperature, and pH. This section describes factors that influence the reaction velocity of enzymes. Enzymic responses to these factors give us valuable clues as to how enzymes function in living cells (that is, in vivo). A. Substrate concentration 1.

If you were to use an assay measuring activity for one second, it would give high activity at high temperatures, however if you were to use an assay measuring product formation over an hour, it would give you low activity at these temperatures. - Effects of pH: Most enzymes are sensitive to pH and have specific ranges of activity.

Most enzymes function between a pH of 6 and 8; however pepsin in the stomach works best at a pH of 2 and trypsin at a pH of 8. - Substrate Saturation: Increasing the substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction (enzyme activity).

Velocity decrease with higher temperature: Further elevation of the temperature causes a decrease in reaction velocity as a result of temperature-induced denaturation of the enzyme (see Fig. 5.7). The optimum temperature for most human enzymes is between 35\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Human enzymes start to denature (see p. 20) at temperatures above 40\u00b0C, but thermophilic bacteria found in hot springs have optimum temperatures of 70\u00b0C.

With increasing substrate concentration , the enzyme is asymptotically approaching its maximum speed Vmax, but never actually reaching it. Because of that, no for Vmax can be given. Instead, the characteristic value for the enzyme is defined by the substrate concentration at its half-maximum speed (Vmax/2).

In general, we would strongly advice researchers to consider the above\u2010mentioned factors: whether there is an inherent response of the enzyme to the applied stimulus, whether the aim is to reuse the enzyme and the reaction must be reversible, whether the reaction set\u2010up would benefit from immobilizing the enzyme, and, lastly, whether multiple enzymes exhibit cross\u2010reactivity and therefore require orthogonal control of all enzymes involved in the reaction.", "known: some are capable of speeding up reactions by factors of 1014 or more.

The forward and backward reactions will therefore be accelerated by the same factor by an enzyme, and the equilibrium point for the reaction will be unchanged (Figure 2\u201323).

Because this group is deprotonated at alkaline pH, the rate of the reaction declines. 2. pH effect on enzyme denaturation: Extremes of pH can also lead to denaturation of the enzyme, because the structure of the catalytically active protein molecule depends on the ionic character of the amino acid side chains. 3.

The method can be used to delete a gene, remove exons, and introduce point mutations. Gene targeting can be permanent or conditional. Conditions can be a specific time during development / life of the organism or limitation to a specific tissue, for example. Gene targeting requires the creation of a specific vector for each gene of interest. However, it can be used for any gene, regardless of transcriptional activity or gene size. # Method Gene targeting methods vary depending on organism.

If the intended mutation site does not create a new RE site (or leads to loss of a pre-existing RE site), additional codons within the guide cleavage site can be considered to introduce silent mutations that may help create (or abolish) an RE site.

This agrees approximately with the measured value of g. The difference may be attributed to several factors, mentioned above under \"Variations\": - The Earth is not homogeneous - The Earth is not a perfect sphere, and an average value must be used for its radius - This calculated value of g does not include the centrifugal force effects that are found in practice due to the rotation of the Earth There are significant", "into your seat as the plane accelerates).

Thus, it is important to establish whether the various laws are applicable or not, inasmuch as they are not applicable in all situations.

After the above discussion of the properties of ATP, current models of the Na+/K+-ATPase are surrounded with questions. Why is nothing said about the adsorption energy of ATP? It is likely that the high energy state is achieved at the moment of ATP binding and not during the next step, when a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to an aspartate residue on the protein.

When required, ATP gives up its energy packet through its energetically favorable hydrolysis to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 2\u201333). The regenerated ADP is then available to be used for another round of the phosphorylation reaction that forms ATP. The energetically favorable reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to many otherwise unfavorable reactions through which other molecules are synthesized. Many of these coupled reactions involve the transfer of the terminal phosphate in ATP to another molecule, as illustrated by the phosphorylation reaction in Figure 2\u201334. As the most abundant activated carrier in cells, ATP is the principle energy currency. To give just two examples, it supplies energy for many of the pumps that transport substances into and out of the cell (discussed in", "energy to fueling this pump, and the pump consumes even more energy in nerve cells and in cells that are dedicated to transport processes, such as those forming kidney tubules.

This electrogenic effect of the pump, however, seldom directly contributes more than 10% to the membrane potential. The remaining 90%, as we discuss later, depends only indirectly on the Na+-K+ pump.

The idea that energy metabolism is regulated by energy charge (as proposed by Atkinson, 1968, 1977) is misleading in mammals.

This increase in distance allows thick filaments to fit in between and interact, enabling deformation or contraction. In deformation, one end of myosin is bound to the plasma membrane while the other end \"walks\" toward the plus end of the actin filament.

Muscular contraction is a fundamental phenomenon in all animals; without it life as we know it would be impossible. The basic mechanism in muscle, including heart muscle, involves the interaction of the protein filaments myosin and actin. Motility in all cells is also partly based on similar interactions of actin filaments with non-muscle myosins. Early studies of muscle contraction have informed later studies of these cellular actin-myosin systems. In muscles, projections on the myosin filaments, the so-called myosin heads or cross-bridges, interact with the nearby actin filaments and, in a mechanism powered by ATP-hydrolysis, they move the actin filaments past them in a kind of cyclic rowing action to produce the macroscopic muscular movements of which we are", "CaATP prolongs strong actomyosin binding and promotes futile myosin stroke. Calcium plays an essential role in muscle contraction, regulating actomyosin interaction by binding troponin of thin filaments. There are several buffers for calcium in muscle, and those buffers play a crucial role in the formation of the transient calcium wave in sarcomere upon muscle activation. One such calcium buffer in muscle is ATP. ATP is a fuel molecule, and the important role of MgATP in muscle is to bind myosin and supply energy for the power stroke. Myosin is not a specific ATPase, and CaATP also supports myosin ATPase activity. The concentration of CaATP in sarcomeres reaches 1% of all ATP available.

The force-generating molecular interaction between myosin thick filaments and actin thin filaments takes place only when a signal passes to the skeletal muscle from the nerve that stimulates it. Immediately upon arrival of the signal, the muscle cell needs to be able to contract very rapidly, with all the sarcomeres shortening simultaneously. Two major features of the muscle cell make extremely rapid contraction possible. First, as previously discussed, the individual myosin motor heads in each thick filament spend only a small fraction of the ATP cycle time bound to the filament and actively generating force, so many myosin heads can act in rapid succession on the same thin filament without interfering with one another. Second, a specialized membrane system relays the incoming", "Kinetics and energetics of the crossbridge cycle. Myosin heads interacting with actin filaments, a process fueled by MgATP and regulated by calcium, powers the pump-like action of the human heart. Hydrolysis of MgATP, the competition between MgATP, its products of hydrolysis, and actin for binding to myosin, and the sequence of shifting affinities in that competition, constitute the central mechanism of muscular contraction. The force, work, and power produced during the cardiac cycle stems from an isomerization of the myosin head that is closely associated with strong binding of myosin to actin and release of phosphate.

At 8 cell stage, hCG has been detected in the embryo using molecular biology techniques.", "hCG. Regular hCG is the main form of hCG associated with the majority of pregnancy and in non-invasive molar pregnancies. This is produced in the trophoblast cells of the placental tissue. Hyperglycosylated hCG is the main form of hCG during the implantation phase of pregnancy, with invasive molar pregnancies, and with choriocarcinoma. Regarding pharmaceutical preparations of hCG from animal or synthetic sources, there are many gonadotropin preparations, some of which are medically justified and others of which are of a quack nature. # Testing Blood or urine tests measure hCG. These can be pregnancy tests. hCG-positive indicates an implanted blastocyst and mammalian embryogenesis. These can be done to diagnose and monitor germ cell tumors and gestational trophoblastic diseases. Concentrations are commonly reported in thousandth international units per milliliter", "The following is a list of serum hCG levels. (LMP is the last menstrual period dated from the first day of the last menstrual period.) The levels grow exponentially after conception and implantation. ## Interpretation The ability to quantitate the \u03b2hCG level is useful in the monitoring germ cell and trophoblastic tumors, follow-up care after miscarriage, and in diagnosis of and follow-up care after treatment of ectopic pregnancy. The lack of a visible fetus on vaginal ultrasound after the \u03b2hCG levels have reached 1500 mIU/ml is strongly indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. Still, even an hCG over 2000 IU/l does not necessarily exclude the presence of a viable intrauterine pregnancy in such cases. As pregnancy tests, quantitative blood tests and the most sensitive urine tests usually detect hCG", "and supportive of the early pregnancy. It raises the body temperature by one-half to one degree Fahrenheit (one-quarter to one-half degree Celsius), thus women who record their basal body temperature on a daily basis will notice that they have entered the luteal phase. If fertilization of an egg has occurred, it will travel as an early blastocyst through the fallopian tube to the uterine cavity and implant itself 6 to 12 days after ovulation. Shortly after implantation, the growing embryo will signal its existence to the maternal system. One very early signal consists of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that pregnancy tests can measure. This signal has an important role in maintaining the corpus luteum and enabling it to continue to produce progesterone. In the absence of", "a hormone named human chorionic gonadotropin which in turn, stimulates the corpus luteum in the woman's ovary to continue producing progesterone. This acts to maintain the lining of the uterus so that the embryo will continue to be nourished. The glands in the lining of the uterus will swell in response to the blastocyst, and capillaries will be stimulated to grow in that region. This allows the blastocyst to receive vital nutrients from the woman. An early sonograph can determine the age of the pregnancy fairly accurately. In practice, doctors typically express the age of a pregnancy (i.e. an \"age\" for an embryo) in terms of \"menstrual date\" based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period, as the woman reports it.

The important hormones during pregnancy are \u03b2-HCG, progesterone and estrogen, which have important effects on physiological activities in pregnant women and the fetus. \u03b2-HCG is a glycoprotein that has a great influence on maintaining the stability of the uterine environment. Estrogen prepares the implantation of the embryo in the uterus. On the basis of estrogenic effects during pregnancy, progesterone keeps the fertilized egg implanted in the uterus and maintains a smooth pregnancy.

Luteal phase is the period between ovulation and either establishment of pregnancy or onset of menstrual cycle 2 weeks later. Following ovulation, the luteal phase of a natural cycle is characterized by the formation of corpus luteum, which secretes steroid hormones estrogen and mainly progesterone.[] Embryonic implantation occurs during the implantation window where perfect synchronization of embryonic and endometrial signals are essential. Following implantation, the developing blastocyst secretes human chorinic gonadotrophin (HCG). Role of HCG is to maintain function of corpus luteum.[] Luteal phase insufficiency is due to inadequate production of progesterone.

LH appears to be responsi-ble for the development and maintenance of the corpus lu-teum during the menstrual cycle. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates within a few days as the hormonal levels drop.

In ARDS, the treatments available are still inadequate and morbidity, mortality, and costs remain unacceptably high. In the last 15 yrs, the morbidity and mortality rates of premature infants suffering from the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) due to surfactant deficiency, have been reduced by exogenous surfactant therapy, and this treatment is now routinely used in most neonatal intensive care units.

Quantitative and qualitative surfactant abnormalities appear to be the primary aetiological factors in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and exogenous replacement of surfactant is a rational treatment. Available exogenous surfactants have a natural (mammal-derived lung surfactants) or synthetic origin. Pharmacodynamic and clinical studies have demonstrated that exogenous surfactants immediately improve pulmonary distensibility and gas exchange; however, this is achieved more slowly and with more failures with synthetic surfactants.

Surfactant is a mixture of lipids and proteins that coats the inside of alveoli and is essential for life due to its key role in preventing alveolar collapse at low lung volumes.

The neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), caused by surfactant deficiency, is characterized by a nonuniform distribution of tidal volumes in the lung parenchyma, epithelial necrosis in peripheral airspaces, and leakage of protein into the alveoli from areas of epithelial disruption. Studies on premature experimental animals have shown that the leakage of protein is correlated to the pressure required to ventilate the lungs, i.e. presumably to the degree of surfactant deficiency. Since the leaking material includes potent surfactant inhibitors, the underlying surfactant deficiency may become aggravated, and a vicious cycle is easily established. Lung compliance is improved, epithelial necrosis prevented, and protein leakage significantly reduced by instillation of surfactant into the airways of immature newborn experimental animals.

The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume.

This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia, inducing a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work in a synergistic fashion in an attempt to maintain homeostasis. Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to the biological phenomenon known as hormesis.

Although the most frequent modifications are protein glycosylation and protein phosphorylation, over 200 different types of covalent modifications are known (see pp. 165\u2013166). protein folds into a compact structure, it buries most of its hydrophobic residues in an interior core. In addition, large numbers of noncovalent interactions form between various parts of the molecule. It is the sum of all of these energetically favorable arrangements that determines the final folding pattern of the polypeptide chain\u2014as the conformation of lowest free energy (see pp. 114\u2013115).

The newly synthesized protein is released from the ribosomal complex, and the ribosome is dissociated from the mRNA. Initiation, elongation, and termination are driven by the hydrolysis of GTP. Initiation in eukaryotes also requires ATP for scanning. Numerous antibiotics interfere with the process of protein synthesis. Many polypeptide chains are covalently modified during or after translation. Such modifications include amino acid removal; phosphorylation, which may activate or inactivate the protein; glycosylation, which plays a role in protein targeting; and hydroxylation such as that seen in collagen. Protein targeting can be either cotranslational (as with secreted proteins) or posttranslational (as with mitochondrial matrix proteins). Proteins must fold to achieve their functional form. Folding", "alternative splicing or alternative post-translational modifications. Finally, many proteins form complexes with other proteins or RNA molecules, and only function in the presence of these other molecules. # Methods of studying proteins ## Determining proteins which are post-translationally modified One way in which a particular protein can be studied is to develop an antibody which is specific to that modification. For example, there are antibodies which only recognize certain proteins when they are tyrosine-phosphorylated; also, there are antibodies specific to other modifications. These can be used to determine the set of proteins that have undergone the modification of interest. For sugar modifications, such as glycosylation of proteins, certain lectins have been discovered which bind sugars. These too can be used. A more common way to determine post-translational modification", "a new scale of hydrophobicity based on the free energy of hydrophobic association has been proposed. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions of the proteins do not have to rely only on the sidechains of amino acids themselves. By various posttranslational modifications other chains can be attached to the proteins, forming hydrophobic lipoproteins or hydrophilic glycoproteins. # Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and side chain properties In addition to the normal amino acid codes, placeholders were used historically in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein could not completely establish the identity of a certain residue in a structure.

There is considerable interest in the use of anabolic hormones, either alone or in combination, in the treatment of catabolic states.

Glucocorticoids increase serum glucose levels and thus stimulate insulin release but inhibit the uptake of glucose by muscle cells, while they stimulate hormone-sensitive lipase and thus lipolysis. The increased insulin secretion stimulates lipogenesis and to a lesser degree inhibits lipolysis, leading to a net increase in fat deposition combined with increased release of fatty acids and glycerol into the circulation. The net results of these actions are most apparent in the fasting state, when the supply of glucose from gluconeogenesis, the release of amino acids from muscle catabolism, the inhibition of peripheral glucose uptake, and the stimulation of lipolysis all contribute to maintenance of an adequate glucose supply to the brain.

Glucagon and epinephrine: Secretion of these counterregulatory hormones is most important in the acute, short-term regulation of blood glucose levels. Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Epinephrine promotes glycogenolysis and lipolysis. It inhibits insulin secretion, thereby preventing GLUT-4\u2013mediated uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissues. Epinephrine assumes a critical role in hypoglycemia when glucagon secretion is deficient, for example, in the late stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus (see p. 340). The prevention or correction of hypoglycemia fails when the secretion of both glucagon and epinephrine is deficient. 2. Cortisol and", "begins if no food is ingested after the absorptive period. It may result from an inability to obtain food, the desire to lose weight rapidly, or clinical situations in which an individual cannot eat (for example, because of trauma, surgery, cancer, or burns). In the absence of food, plasma levels of glucose, amino acids, and TAG fall, triggering a decline in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol secretion. The decreased insulin/counterregulatory hormone ratio and the decreased availability of circulating substrates make the postabsorptive period of nutrient deprivation a catabolic period characterized by degradation of TAG, glycogen, and protein. This sets into motion an exchange of substrates among the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain that is guided by two priorities: 1) the need", "the requirements for gluconeogenesis from muscle protein, however. The high concentrations of counterregulatory hormones, cortisol, epinephrine, and glucagon will minimize glucose utilization by insulin-sensitive tissues, despite high concentrations of both glucose and insulin, but these hormones are not able to prevent suppression of ketone body synthesis in the liver. As a result, the brain continues to derive almost all its energy from oxidation of glucose. Synthesis of this glucose in liver is the biggest consumer of amino acids made available by net degradation of muscle protein.

In the fasted state, cortisol stimulates several processes that collectively serve to increase and maintain normal concentrations of glucose in blood. These effects include: - Stimulation of gluconeogenesis, particularly in the liver: This pathway results in the synthesis of glucose from non-hexose substrates such as amino acids and lipids and is particularly important in carnivores and certain herbivores. Enhancing the expression of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis is probably the best-known metabolic function of glucocorticoids. - Mobilization of amino acids from extrahepatic tissues: These serve as substrates for gluconeogenesis. - Inhibition of glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue: A mechanism to conserve glucose. - Stimulation of fat breakdown in adipose", "blood cells require a source of amino acids and other nutrients. Synthesis of acute-phase proteins required for host defense also needs amino acids. In addition, the wound, regenerating tissue, and white blood cells require large amounts of glucose for glycolysis. That the wound is poorly vascularized may be the major reason for hyperglycemia, which provides a glucose gradient between plasma and tissue high enough for extraction of sufficient glucose. The wound does not increase net consumption of glucose; rather, lactate returns to the liver to be converted again to glucose.

Thus, Ala carries nitrogen to the liver for conversion to urea (see figure below). Therefore, defects in the urea cycle would result in an elevation in NH3, Gln, and Ala.

In muscle, aspartate can be used to replenish tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates via the purine-nucleotide cycle.

Most cellular ATP is produced from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by oxidative phosphorylation during reduction of oxygen in the electron transport system of mitochondria.

A good example would be the oxidation of glucose (a monosaccharide) in aerobic respiration. The energy released in this equation is about 2880 kJ per mol, which is conserved in regenerating 38 ATP from 38 ADP per glucose. This is a factor of 19 times more energy per sugar molecule than the typical anaerobic reaction generates. Eukaryotic organisms (everything but bacteria) only get a net gain of 36 ATP regenerated from ADP in this process, due to an additional membrane that must be crossed by active transport. Notice that oxygen is used during the oxidation of glucose and water is produced.

Ultimately, growth factors, nutrient supplies, and oxygen availability, as well as cellular signaling pathways and sensors that respond to these exogenous factors, govern these metabolic decisions. Cell Death. Mitochondria are like the proverbial Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

To counteract these reactive oxygen species, cells contain numerous antioxidant systems, including antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases.which detoxify the reactive species, limiting damage to the cell. # Inhibitors There are several well-known drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although any one of these toxins only inhibits one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. For example, if oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH", "molecules of ATP. Most cells will then carry out further reactions to 'repay' the used NAD+ and produce a final product of ethanol or lactic acid. Many bacteria use inorganic compounds as hydrogen acceptors to regenerate the NAD+. Cells performing aerobic respiration synthesize much more ATP, but not as part of glycolysis. These further aerobic reactions use pyruvate and NADH + H+ from glycolysis. Eukaryotic aerobic respiration produces approximately 34 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule, however most of these are produced by a vastly different mechanism to the substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. The lower energy production, per glucose, of anaerobic respiration relative to aerobic respiration, results in greater flux through the pathway under hypoxic (low-oxygen) conditions, unless alternative sources of anerobically-oxidizable substrates, such as fatty", "added to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). When required, ATP gives up its energy packet through its energetically favorable hydrolysis to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 2\u201333). The regenerated ADP is then available to be used for another round of the phosphorylation reaction that forms ATP. The energetically favorable reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to many otherwise unfavorable reactions through which other molecules are synthesized. Many of these coupled reactions involve the transfer of the terminal phosphate in ATP to another molecule, as illustrated by the phosphorylation reaction in Figure 2\u201334.

The muscle does still receive oxygen during anaerobic exercise; the average drop in blood oxygen content throughout the body is likely minimal.

In humans, at this point cells are 46 chromosomes, 2N, identical to somatic cells. - Synthesis (S) phase: The genetic material is replicated: each of its chromosomes duplicates, producing 46 chromosomes", "complement of dna and are therefore in g1, those that have a fully replicated complement of dna (twice the g1 dna content) and are in g2 or m phase, and those that have an intermediate amount of dna and are in s phase. The distribution of cells indicates that there are greater numbers of cells in g1 than in g2 + m phase, showing that g1 is longer than g2 + m in this population.

Non parametric methods (or graphical methods: rectangle, peak reflect) only use one or two phase(s) of the cell cycle, the remaining phase(s) being estimated by exclusion. In parametric methods (Dean & Jett, Baisch II, Fried), the DNAT(x) distribution is supposed to be known and is composed of two gaussians (representative of G0/1 and G2 + M) and a P(x,y) function representative of S phase. Despite the generality, these models are not applicable to all sample types, particularly heterogeneous cell populations with various DNA content. In addition, the cell cycle is dependent on several regulation points (transition from quiescence to proliferation, DNA synthesis initiation, mitosis induction) and", "DNA. In humans, at this point cells are 46 chromosomes, 2N, identical to somatic cells. - Synthesis (S) phase: The genetic material is replicated: each of its chromosomes duplicates, producing 46 chromosomes each made up of two sister chromatids. The cell is still considered diploid because it still contains the same number of centromeres. The identical sister chromatids have not yet condensed into the densely packaged chromosomes visible with the light microscope. This will take place during prophase I in meiosis. - Gap 2 (G2) phase: G2 phase is absent in Meiosis Interphase is followed by meiosis I and then meiosis II. Meiosis I consists of separating the pairs of homologous chromosome, each made up of two sister chromatids, into two cells. One entire haploid content of chromosomes", "phases Most cells require much more time to grow and double their mass of proteins and organelles than they require to duplicate their chromosomes and divide. Partly to allow time for growth, most cell cycles have gap phases\u2014a G1 phase between M phase and S phase and a G2 phase between S phase and mitosis. Thus, the eukaryotic cell cycle is traditionally divided into four sequential phases: G1, S, G2, and M. G1, S, and G2 together are called interphase (Figure 17\u20134, and see Figure 17\u20133). In a typical human cell proliferating in culture, interphase might occupy 23 hours of a 24-hour cycle, with 1 hour for M phase. Cell growth occurs throughout the cell cycle, except during mitosis. The two gap phases are more than simple time", "internal organs are renewed. # Phases of the cell cycle The cell cycle consists of four distinct phases: G1 phase, S phase, G2 phase (collectively known as interphase) and M phase. M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes: mitosis, in which the cell's chromosomes are divided between the two daughter cells, and cytokinesis, in which the cell's cytoplasm divides forming distinct cells. Activation of each phase is dependent on the proper progression and completion of the previous one. Cells that have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of quiescence called G0 phase. ## M phase The relatively brief M phase consists of nuclear division (mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis). In plants and algae, cytokinesis is accompanied by the formation", "those of the parental cell. The cell cycle incorporates two principal phases: the interphase, representing continuous growth of the cell, and the M phase (mitosis), characterized by the partition of the genome. Three other phases, G1 (gap1) phase, S (synthesis) phase, and G2 (gap2) phase, further subdivide interphase (Fig. 3.10). Rapidly renewing populations of human cells progress through the full cell cycle in about 24 hours. Throughout the cycle, several internal quality-control mechanisms or checkpoints represented by biochemical pathways control transition between cell-cycle stages. The cell cycle stops at several checkpoints and can only proceed if certain conditions are met\u2014for example, if the cell has reached a certain size. Checkpoints monitor and modulate the progression of cells through the cell cycle in response to intracellular or environmental signals.", "the chromosomes have been replicated, i.e., each chromosome has two (sister) chromatids. Thus, during this phase, the amount of DNA in the cell has effectively doubled, though the ploidy of the cell remains the same. Rates of RNA transcription and protein synthesis are very low during this phase. An exception to this is histone production, most of which occurs during the S phase. The duration of S phase is relatively constant among cells of the same species. ### G2 phase The cell then enters the G2 phase, which lasts until the cell enters mitosis. Again, significant protein synthesis occurs during this phase, mainly involving the production of microtubules, which are required during the process of mitosis. Inhibition of protein synthesis during G2 phase prevents the cell from undergoing", "of quiescence called G0 phase. ## M phase The relatively brief M phase consists of nuclear division (mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis). In plants and algae, cytokinesis is accompanied by the formation of a new cell wall. ## Interphase After M phase, the daughter cells each begin interphase of a new cycle. Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for initiation of cell division. ### G1 phase The first phase within interphase, from the end of the previous M phase till the beginning of DNA synthesis is called G1 (G indicating gap or growth).

However, this limitation is expected to have limited impact on our conclusions since the contribution from glycogen is excluded when calculating the GNG rate and the overall contribution from TCA amino acids is not dominant in all three fasting conditions. Second, our current flux model assumes TCA amino acids contribute to GNG via a universal pool of TCA intermediates, though, in reality, liver and peripheral tissues may functionally use two separate pools.

TGs within adipocytes undergo lipolysis to FFAs and glycerol, and there is a general net proteolysis with the release of AAs during the fasting state. The glycerol and gluconeogenic AAs are released from cells and circulate to the liver, where they are subsequently used for gluconeogenesis.

Genetic of mitochondrial epilepsy]. INTRODUCTION: Recently the molecular basis of a series of clinical disorders associated with defects in the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS system) leading to ATP synthesis, the final pathway of mitochondrial energy metabolism, has been established. The polypeptide components of the OXPHOS system are codified in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Therefore these mitochondrial diseases may be originated by mutations of genes found in both genetic systems. DEVELOPMENT: In recent years, several such neuromuscular diseases have been defined and associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations. One of the most striking of these is the syndrome of myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres (MERRF), characterized by myoclonic epilepsy of maternal inheritance. This disorder is caused by a specific mutation on the", "termed homoplasmy. Alternatively, it may contain both normal and mutated DNA, namely heteroplasmy. If a heteroplasmic oocyte is fertilized, the relative proportion ofmutated DNA may afect whether the individual manifests a given mitochondrial disease. It is not possible to predict the potential degree of heteroplasmy among ofspring, and this poses challenges for genetic counseling. As of 2016, 33 mitochondrial diseases or conditions with known molecular basis were described in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man Qohns Hopkins University, 2017). Examples include myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), Leber optic atrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Leigh syndrome, several forms of mitochondrial myopathy and cardiomyopathy, and susceptibility to chloramphenicol toxicity. Mendel's irst law is that genes are passed unchanged from parent to progeny, and barring new mutations, this is true for many", "cases mapped to chromosome 15q, a mutation affects the gene encoding mtDNA polymerase (POLG), an enzyme important in mtDNA replication. Autosomal recessive PEO has also been described with mutations in the POLG gene. Point mutations have been identified within various mitochondrial tRNA (Leu, Ile, Asn, Trp) genes in families with maternal inheritance of PEO.

Multiple defects affecting respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV were detected in 2 patients. The point mutation at 8344 of the mitochondrial genome was found in all the maternal lineage with a relatively narrow range of variation in the percentage of mutant mitochondrial genomes.

Careful identification of large pedigrees that were consistent with maternal inheritance has permitted detailed clinical and genetic investigations.

MERRF is caused by an A to G mutation of the mitochondrial tRNA(Lys) at position 8344. The mutation is maternally inherited and heteroplasmic. Disease manifestations are dependent on replicative segregation of mutant and wild type mitochondrial DNAs and on the threshold effect.

In mitochondrial disorders caused by mtDNA point mutations, which are maternally inherited and subject to the randomness of the heteroplasmy, signs, symptoms and organ involvement are highly heterogeneous from an individual to another, which accounts for a very high degree of both inter- and intra-familial variability. This is why, in these cases, each affected subject will have a different prognosis. For example, MELAS and MERFF point mutations are associated with several, extremely variable clinical pictures, and the majority of patients do not have full-blown MELAS or MERRF syndrome. In particular, subjects with MELAS point mutations who never have a stroke, or with MERRF point mutation without myoclonic epilepsy, have a totally different, and much better, prognosis compared with individuals", "of her offspring. To obtain a more accurate description of the inheritance of pathogenic mtDNA mutations, we studied a large number of pedigrees that carried either the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (A3243G MELAS) or the myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibres (A8344G MERRF) mutations. We made two principal observations. First, for both mutations, higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the mothers' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring. Secondly, at any one level of maternal mutation load there was a greater frequency of affected offspring for the A3243G MELAS mutation than for the A8344G MERRF mutation.

This depolarization spreads across the surface of the muscle fiber into transverse tubules, eliciting the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus initiating muscle contraction.

Normally, a nerve impulse arrives at the motor nerve terminal, initiating an influx of calcium ions which causes the releases of acetylcholine.

However, activation of the fatty acid requires two ATP. Therefore, the net yield from palmitate is 129 ATP (Fig. 16.18). A", "# Energy yield The ATP yield for every oxidation cycle is 14 ATP, broken down as follows: For an even-numbered saturated fat (C2n), n - 1 oxidations are necessary and the final process yields an additional acetyl CoA. In addition, two equivalents of ATP are lost during the activation of the fatty acid. Therefore, the total ATP yield can be stated as: For instance, the ATP yield of palmitate (C16, n = 8) is: Represented in table form: For sources that use the larger ATP production numbers described above, the total would be 129 ATP equivalents per palmitate.", "latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which glucose (C6H12O6) and stearin (C57H110O6) are convenient examples.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our goal is to explain how 2H(2)O, a stable isotope of water, can be used to quantify metabolic flux in vivo. Although 2H(2)O was originally used more than 65 years ago, recent reports have described new applications. Investigators have also refined the original work. We discuss those points, emphasizing factors that should be considered when interpreting data. As our goal is to discuss why 2H(2)O is a novel tracer for studying metabolism, we do not comment on the interpretation(s) of physiological data.

Only the final step of oxidative metabolism consumes molecular oxygen (O2) directly (see Figure 14\u201310). Nearly all the energy available from metabolizing carbohydrates, fats, and other foodstuffs in earlier stages is saved in the form of energy-rich compounds that feed electrons into the respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These electrons, most of which are carried by NADH, finally combine with O2 at the end of the respiratory chain to form water.

This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle.

Glucose is the greatly preferred energy source for the brain and the required energy source for cells with few or no mitochondria such as mature red blood cells. Glucose is also essential as an energy source for exercising muscle, where it is the substrate for anaerobic glycolysis. Blood glucose can be obtained from three primary sources: the diet, glycogen degradation, and gluconeogenesis.

It is quite clear that the adaptive response to exercise depends on the intensity of the exercise, and the eventual ROS production, which is intensity dependent (Fig. 1). Exercise with very high intensity using ATP, CrP as the main energy sources, where fatigue is due to the accumulation of Pi, AMP, H+, ammonia and other metabolic products, is not normal practice. Recovery is very fast after anaerobic alactic dominant fatigue. When ATP is regenerated from mainly glycolytic pathways decreased pH and Na-K pump excitability levels could lead to fatigue, among other factors, but recovery within an hour. When aerobic exercise is used, one of the reasons for fatigue is the depletion of muscle glycogen. The recovery", "conclusions that (a) hypersomolarity is unlikely to be in an important factor initiating or maintaining functional hyperaemia in skeletal muscle, (b) while K+ release may contribute in fast muscle it can hardly be the factor initiating the response, and (c) inorganic phosphate is the only substance tested so far whose efflux is consistently related to the vascular response in all muscles under a variety of experimental conditions, and whose efficacy as a vasodilator seems adequate.", "intracellular pH is also a likely player in reducing Vmax during muscle fatigue. The myosin ATPase activity is lowered at low pH, perhaps because of lower rates of release of ADP from the myosin head, which has been found to reduce Vmax (;;. It has been noticed that in the initial phase of muscle fatigue, small decreases in Fmax could occur in the absence of appreciable change in Vmax (;. Because phosphocreatine is the energy reserve (\u223c20 mM) in muscle cells used first to replenish ATP in a process that produces inorganic phosphate, short-term fatigue is likely mainly caused by an increase in intracellular [Pi]. As mentioned above, high [Pi] is able to reduce Fmax without affecting Vmax, making it a likely candidate for causing the initial decrease", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt.

Note that only the two polar regions of the intrafusal muscle contract; the equatorial region, where the nuclei are located, does not contract because it has little contractile protein. Nevertheless, when the polar regions contract, the equatorial region elongates and regains its sensitivity. Conversely, when a muscle relaxes (\u03b1 motor neuron activity drops) and thus elongates (if its ends are being pulled), a concurrent decrease in \u03b3 motor neuron activity allows the intrafusal fibers to relax (and thus elongate) as well and thereby prevent the tension on the central portion of the intrafusal fiber from reaching a level at which firing of the afferent fibers is saturated.

Two major features of the muscle cell make extremely rapid contraction possible. First, as previously discussed, the individual myosin motor heads in each thick filament spend only a small fraction of the ATP cycle time bound to the filament and actively generating force, so many myosin heads can act in rapid succession on the same thin filament without interfering with one another.

The sustained initial increase in myoplasmic Ca2+ caused by insertion of a high-frequency doublet stimulus at the beginning of a tetanus gives rise to a straightforward mechanism to explain the observed faster rate of rise of tetanic force in the presence of the doublet. As modeled by the authors, sustaining the early increase in Ca2+ concentration is predicted to increase the binding of Ca2+ to troponin C during the rising phase of tetanic force, which in turn would increase the activation of the thin filament and thus the number of cross-bridges that can bind to actin.

Acetyl-CoA may then be used in the citric acid cycle to carry out cellular respiration, and this complex links the glycolysis metabolic pathway to the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate", "muscle, or the heart. Within the heart, lactate dehydrogenase plays the role of converting lactate back into pyruvate so that the pyruvate can be used again to create more energy. With the mutated enzyme, the overall rate of this conversion is decreased. However, unlike lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, this mutation does not appear to cause any symptoms or health problems linked to this condition. At the present moment, it is unclear why this is the case. Affected individuals are usually discovered only when routine blood tests indicate low LDH levels present within the blood. # Role in muscular fatigue The onset of acidosis during periods of intense exercise is commonly attributed to accumulation of lactic acid. From this reasoning, the idea of lactate production being a primary cause of", "group from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and then is regenerated as the cycle is completed (see Fig. 9.1). Two carbons enter the cycle as acetyl CoA and two leave as CO2. Therefore, the entry of one acetyl CoA into one round of the TCA cycle does not lead to the net production or consumption of intermediates. A. Acetyl CoA production The major source of acetyl CoA for the TCA cycle is the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH complex, or PDHC). However, the PDHC (described below) is not a component of the TCA cycle. Pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, is transported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix by the pyruvate mitochondrial carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the matrix,", "high and insulin is low (for example, as seen in fasting or diabetes). VII. ALTERNATE FATES OF PYRUVATE Pyruvate can be metabolized to products other than lactate. A. Oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl CoA Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the PDHC is an important pathway in tissues with a high oxidative capacity such as cardiac muscle (Fig. 8.24). PDHC irreversibly converts pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, into acetyl CoA, a TCA cycle substrate (see p. 109) and the carbon source for fatty acid synthesis (see p. 183). B. Carboxylation to oxaloacetate Carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase is a biotin-dependent reaction (see Fig. 8.24). This irreversible reaction is important because it replenishes the TCA cycle intermediate and provides substrate for gluconeogenesis (see p. 118). C.", "absent LDH activity. There is currently no specific treatment for this condition. In the case of lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency, mutations to the LDHB gene result in the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase-B subunit that cannot bind to the other subunits to form the complete enzyme. As with lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, this mutation reduces the overall effectiveness in the enzyme. However, there are some major differences between these two cases. The first is the location where the condition manifests itself. With lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency, the highest concentration of B subunits can be found within the cardiac muscle, or the heart. Within the heart, lactate dehydrogenase plays the role of converting lactate back into pyruvate so that the pyruvate can be used again to create more energy. With the", "step 6 begins the energy-generation phase of glycolysis. Because two molecules of aTp are hydrolyzed in the early, energy-investment phase, glycolysis results in the net synthesis of 2 aTp and 2 naDh molecules per molecule of glucose (see also panel 2\u20138). Figure 2\u201347 Two pathways for the anaerobic breakdown of pyruvate. (a) When there is inadequate oxygen, for example, in a muscle cell undergoing vigorous contraction, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to lactate as shown. This reaction regenerates the naD+ consumed in step 6 of glycolysis, but the whole pathway yields much less energy overall than complete oxidation. (B) in some organisms that can grow anaerobically, such as yeasts, pyruvate is C regeneration C converted via acetaldehyde into carbon dioxide and ethanol. again, this pathway CO", "muscle and by cells that lack mitochondria such as RBC. In the Cori cycle, this lactate is taken up by the liver and oxidized to pyruvate that is converted to glucose, which is released back into the circulation (Fig. 10.2). C. Amino acids Amino acids produced by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are the major sources of glucose during a fast. Their metabolism generates \u03b1-keto acids, such as pyruvate that is converted to glucose, or \u03b1-ketoglutarate that can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and form oxaloacetate (OAA), a direct precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). [Note: Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose.

Pyruvate reduction to lactate Lactate, formed from pyruvate by LDH, is the final product of anaerobic glycolysis in eukaryotic cells (Fig. 8.21). Reduction to lactate is the major fate for pyruvate in tissues that are poorly vascularized (for example, the lens and cornea of the eye and the kidney medulla) or in RBC that lack mitochondria. 1. Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH.

The second principle is the constancy of PCr and H(+) (lactate) production by glycogenolysis due to the coupling of ATPase and glycolysis. This principle enables glycogenolytic flux to be measured from intracellular proton loads.

Anaerobic glycolysis produces lactate, ATP, and water but there is no net change in the number of hydrogen ions: it does not produce lactic acid. The acidosis usually associated with hyperlactataemia is caused by hydrolysis of the ATP, with release of hydrogen ions. By contrast, ATP turnover by aerobic mechanisms is not acidifying because the released hydrogen ion is reutilised as more ATP is formed. Gluconeogenesis from lactate does not utilise hydrogen ions directly--in fact, it produces them.

This is because lactate itself is not capable of releasing a proton, and secondly, the acidic form of lactate, lactic acid, cannot be formed under normal circumstances in human tissues.

Experimentally, oxygen diffusion becomes rate limiting (and lethal) when arterial oxygen partial pressure falls to 40mmHg or below. If oxygen delivery to cells is insufficient for the demand (hypoxia), hydrogen will be shifted to pyruvic acid converting it to lactic acid.

The data collected varied; those looking at signalized crossing were concerned with time taken to cross and measured this from the point at which the pedestrian stepped onto the crossing until the point they stepped off. This was then converted to a speed by using the shortest crossing distance. Many of these studies also recorded whether the pedestrian finished crossing before the start of the red pedestrian signal.

This ratio exceeds 20 among pedestrians and cyclists. Similarly, more than one quarter of child pedestrian injuries happen in the most deprived tenth of wards (Greyling et al. 2002). The largest factor resulting in this difference in death rate is exposure to danger rather than behaviour (Edwards et al. 2006).

The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor.

Certain cells, such as cardiac muscle cells, are highly permeable to lactate. Lactate is converted into pyruvate and metabolised normally (ie: via the citric acid cycle). Since these cells are highly oxygenated, it is unlikely that lactate would accumulate (as is the case in oxygen-starved muscle cells).

As might be expected, therefore, maximising the contribution from oxidative ATP regeneration at the onset of exercise (by pharmacologically activating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex prior to exercise) has been shown to have substantial functional benefits during high intensity contraction.

After several seconds, further ATP energy is made available to muscles by metabolizing muscle glycogen into pyruvate through glycolysis, as it normally does through the aerobic cycle.

Contrary to popular belief, this increased concentration of lactate does not directly cause acidosis, nor is it responsible for delayed onset muscle soreness. This is because lactate itself is not capable of releasing a proton, and secondly, the acidic form of lactate, lactic acid, cannot be formed under normal circumstances in human tissues. Analysis of the glycolytic pathway in humans indicates that there are not enough hydrogen ions present in the glycolytic intermediates to produce lactic or any other acid.

Indeed, Kopennol et al. suggest that the increased lactate production in tumor cells arises from damage to the regulation of glycolysis and not to insufficient respiration. However, the competing argument is inconsistent with the observation that the lactate made by muscle cells during intense exercise falls significantly after oxygen is restored to the muscle tissue. This would indicate that the lactate was made primarily because O2 was unavailable for robust OxPhos. In addition, oxygen deprivation or hypoxia causes all known cultured mammalian cells to increase lactate production.

Within the voluntary skeletal muscles, the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules in the process (note that in aerobic conditions, lactate is not formed; instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle). Muscle cells also contain globules of fat, which are used for energy during aerobic exercise. The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP and reach peak efficiency, and requires many more biochemical steps, but produces significantly more ATP than anaerobic glycolysis.

However, it can take 2-4 min, or even longer at higher work rates, before this steady state is attained. Slow VO(2) kinetics increase the so-called O(2) deficit and obligate a greater contribution from anaerobic mechanisms of ATP production (involving the breakdown of muscle high energy phosphates and lactate production from glycogen) to meet the ATP requirement of the exercise task.

In short: the choice made by nature in using calcium as intracellular messenger was very early in the history of life; all cellular structures devoted to intracellular calcium regulation, from the simplest form of amoeba to the highly sophisticated apparatus of mammalian skeletal muscle, can be linked together in the chain of evolution. Because the evidence is still sparse, any conclusion more", "calcium storages. Ca2+ entering the cell plasma causes the specific action of the cell, whatever this action is: secretory cells release vesicles with their secretion, muscle cells contract, synapses release synaptic vesicles and go into processes of synaptic plasticity, etc. Calcium's function in muscle contraction was found as early as 1882 by Ringer and led the way for further investigations to reveal its role as a messenger about a century later. Because its action is interconnected with cAMP, they are called synarchic messengers. Calcium can bind to several different calcium-modulated proteins such as troponin-C (the first one to be identified) or calmodulin. The ions are stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells.

A high concentration of Ca2+-binding proteins in the ER facilitates Ca2+ storage. In some cell types, and perhaps in most, specific regions of the ER are specialized for Ca2+ storage. Muscle cells have an abundant, modified smooth ER called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release and reuptake of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum trigger myofibril contraction and relaxation, respectively, during each round of muscle contraction (discussed in Chapter 16).

The large concentration gradient results is an extremely high Ca flux whenever a Ca channel opens to connect the myoplasm to the SR or extracellular spaces. This is optimal for cellular function since a large amount of Ca enters the myoplasm quickly, as is necessary for contraction. But this causes problems for", "level thanks to our senior researchers. Thus, the final question we had to answer was how to connect these two currents. We found that low concentrations of Ca ions (10(-7)-10(-4) M) released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum for the regulation of muscle contraction simultaneously reversibly activate phosphorylase kinase, the enzyme regulating glycogenolysis. Moreover, we found that adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), which is already known to activate muscle phosphorylase kinase, is not effective in the absence of such concentrations of Ca ions. Thus, cyclic AMP is not effective by itself alone and only modifies the activation process in the presence of Ca ions (at that time, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase had not yet been identified). After a while, it turned out that our works have not only provided the solution", "Ca2+. It is especially important in neurons and muscle cells. In heart and pancreas cells, another second messenger (cyclic ADP ribose) takes part in the receptor activation. The localized and time-limited activity of Ca2+ in the cytosol is also called a Ca2+ wave. Once released into the cytosol from intracellular stores or extracellular sources, Ca2+ acts as a signal molecule within the cell. This works by tightly limiting the time and space when Ca2+ is free (and thus active). Therefore, the concentration of free Ca2+ within the cell is usually very low; it is stored within organelles, usually the endoplasmic reticulum (sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells), where it is bound to molecules like calreticulin. Ca2+ is used in a multitude of processes, among them muscle contraction, release of", "Ca2+ pump, or Ca2+ ATPase, in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane of skeletal muscle cells is a well-understood P-type transport ATPase. The SR is a specialized type of endoplasmic reticulum that forms a network of tubular sacs in the muscle cell cytoplasm, and it serves as an intracellular store of Ca2+. When an action potential depolarizes the muscle cell plasma membrane, Ca2+ is released into the cytosol from the SR through Ca2+-release channels, stimulating the muscle to contract (discussed in Chapters 15 and 16). The Ca2+ pump, which accounts for about 90% of the membrane protein of the SR, moves Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the SR. The endoplasmic reticulum of nonmuscle cells contains a similar Ca2+ pump, but in smaller quantities.

He published his work in 1957.

Indeed, skeletal muscle fibers have huge amounts of sarcoplasmic reticulum that is extremely rich in Ca pumps (sarco/ER-Ca ATPase) and contains a high buffering capacity (calsequestrin). On the other hand, Ca extrusion through the plasma membrane is very slow, so almost all of the Ca released during contraction is immediately restored after stimulation. Accordingly, twitch contractions can thus be produced repeatedly for hours in the absence of extracellular Ca.

To date, relatively little attention has been placed on the role of the central nervous system (CNS) in fatigue during exercise despite the fact that the unwillingness to generate and maintain adequate CNS drive to the working muscle is the most likely explanation of fatigue for most people during normal activities. Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain CNS fatigue. Hypotheses have been developed for several neurotransmitters including serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine), dopamine, and acetylcholine.

When the ambient temperature was increased, dopaminergic and combined dopaminergic and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition appeared to override a safety switch, allowing subjects to push harder and become much warmer, without changing their perception.

CYCLE OVERVIEW The tricarboxylic acid cycle ([TCA cycle] also called the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle) plays several roles in metabolism. It is the final pathway where the oxidative catabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids converge, their carbon skeletons being converted to carbon dioxide (CO2), as shown in cycle. The TCA cycle is an aerobic pathway, because oxygen (O2) is required as the final electron acceptor. Reactions such as the catabolism of some amino acids generate intermediates of the cycle and are called anaplerotic (from the Greek for \u201cfilling up\u201d) reactions. The TCA cycle also provides intermediates for a number of important anabolic reactions, such as", "Ketone bodies are an alternate to the use of glucose, and, thus, dependence on glucose increases. Because FA \u03b2-oxidation supplies the NADH and the nucleoside triphosphates needed for gluconeogenesis, glucose production decreases. The result is a hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Recall that this was seen with medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. Case 4: Answers to Review Questions RQ1.Answer = D. The rise in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in the mitochondria decreases the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid (FA) oxidation, and gluconeogenesis. NADH inhibits the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction, the key regulated step of the TCA cycle, and the \u03b1ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction (see figure at bottom right). It also favors the reduction of oxaloacetate (OAA) to malate (not malate to OAA), decreasing the availability of OAA for condensation with", "energy (as ATP) and intermediates for other metabolic pathways. Glycolysis is at the hub of carbohydrate metabolism because virtually all sugars, whether arising from the diet or from catabolic reactions in the body, can ultimately be converted to glucose (Fig. 8.9A). Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate is reduced to lactate as NADH is oxidized to NAD+ (Fig. 8.9C). This conversion of glucose to lactate is called anaerobic", "oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids. Fats are catabolised by hydrolysis to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Amino acids are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide", "processes required in different tissues are not the same. For example, nerve cells, which are probably the most fastidious cells in the body, maintain almost no reserves of glycogen or fatty acids and rely almost entirely on a constant Figure 2\u201362 The nine essential amino acids.

Pyruvic acid is converted into acetyl-coenzyme A, which is the main input for a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle. Pyruvate is also converted to oxaloacetate by an anaplerotic reaction which replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates; alternatively, the oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis. These reactions are named after Hans Adolf Krebs, the biochemist awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize for physiology, jointly with Fritz Lipmann, for research into metabolic processes. The cycle is also called the citric acid cycle, because citric acid is one of the intermediate compounds formed during the reactions. If insufficient oxygen is available, the acid is broken down anaerobically, creating lactic", "is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis.

They perform a variety of functions such as intracellular signaling of oxygen tension and key roles in programmed cell death. From a biochemical perspective, mitochondria are the key site of energy production in the cell. Indeed they are the site of beta oxidation (see Chapter 55), the Krebs cycle, and parts of the urea cycle (see Figure 53-4). This complexity requires more than 1000 proteins localized specifically to the mitochondrion. Only 13 of these", "the cell Many enzymes are localized in specific organelles within the cell (Fig. 5.3). Such compartmentalization serves to isolate the reaction substrate or product from other competing reactions. This provides a favorable environment for the reaction and organizes the thousands of enzymes present in the cell into purposeful pathways. IV. MECHANISM OF ENZYME ACTION The mechanism of enzyme action can be viewed from two different perspectives. The first treats catalysis in terms of energy changes that occur during the reaction. That is, enzymes provide an alternate, energetically favorable reaction pathway different from the uncatalyzed reaction. The second perspective describes how the active site chemically facilitates catalysis. A.

In prokaryotes, all chemical reactions take place in the cytosol. In eukaryotes, the cytosol surrounds the cell organelles; this is collectively called cytoplasm. In plants, the amount of cytosol can be reduced because of the large tonoplast (central vacuole) that takes up most of the cell interior volume.

This article develops a rational analysis of an important class of apparent preference reversals-joint-separate reversals traditionally explained by the evaluability hypothesis. The \"options-as-information\" model considers a hypothetical rational actor with limited knowledge about the market distribution of a stimulus attribute. The actor's evaluations are formed via a 2-stage process-an inferential stage in which beliefs are updated on the basis of the sample of options received, followed by an assessment stage in which options are evaluated in light of these updated beliefs. This process generates joint-separate reversals in standard experimental designs. The normative model explains why the evaluability hypothesis works when it does, identifies boundary conditions for the hypothesis, and clarifies some common misconceptions about these effects.

Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the physiocratic school. Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to social situations where there is no monetary consideration, such as politics, law, psychology, history, religion, marriage and family life, and other social interactions.

Once moved out of muscles with high concentrations within the sarcomere, lactic acid can be used by other muscles or body tissues as a source of energy, or transported to the liver where it is converted back to pyruvate.

The accumulation of lactate beyond the lactate threshold [T(lact)] does provide an indication that the mechanisms of lactate removal fail to keep pace with lactate production.

Lactate diffuses out of the cell and into the blood.The lactate in the bloodstream is converted back into pyruvate in the liver, for use when oxygen is once again present. Certain cells, such as cardiac muscle cells, are highly permeable to lactate. Lactate is converted into pyruvate and metabolised normally (ie: via the citric acid cycle). Since these cells are highly oxygenated, it is unlikely that lactate would accumulate (as is the case in oxygen-starved muscle cells).

In such cases, the capillary blood pH can fall from 7.45 to around 7.05,whereas for skeletal muscles the pH can fall from 7.1 to 6.4.It is not lactate itself that leads to muscle fatigue, but most likely the associated fall in pH.", "begins with muscles utilizing stored creatine phosphate to generate the ATP that produces muscle contraction. After several seconds, further ATP energy is made available to muscles by metabolizing muscle glycogen into pyruvate through glycolysis, as it normally does through the aerobic cycle. What differs is that pyruvate, rather than be broken down through the slower but more energy efficient aerobic process, is fermented to lactic acid. Muscle glycogen is restored from blood sugar, which comes from the liver, from digested carbohydrates, or from amino acids which have been turned into glucose. # Lactate threshold (Now called LIP or Lactate Inflection Point) The lactate threshold (LT) is the exercise intensity at which lactate starts to accumulate in the blood stream.

This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH. Therefore, during intense exercise, lactate accumulates in muscle, causing a drop in the intracellular pH, potentially resulting in cramps. Much of this lactate eventually diffuses into the bloodstream and can be used by the liver to make glucose (see p. 118). 2. Lactate utilization: The direction of the LDH reaction depends on the relative intracellular concentrations of pyruvate and lactate and on the ratio of NADH/NAD+. For example, in the liver and heart, this ratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate.

At the present moment, it is unclear why this is the case.

During anaerobic exercise, the muscles being exercised have insufficient oxygen to meet the demands of the activity, and thus must also use alternate, non-oxygen-dependent processes to produce energy. The muscle does still receive oxygen during anaerobic exercise; the average drop in blood oxygen content throughout the body is likely minimal.

There are several different ways to categorize the type of skeletal muscle. One method uses the type of protein contained in myosin (one of the important proteins that is responsible for the ability of muscle to contract). Using this classification scheme, there are two major types of fibers for skeletal muscles: Type I and Type II. Type I fibers appear reddish. They are good for endurance and are slow to tire because they use oxidative metabolism. Type II fibers are whitish; they are used for short bursts of speed and power, and use both oxidative metabolism and anaerobic metabolism depending on the particular sub-type, and are therefore quicker to tire. #", "fibers, generally through a combination of genetics and training. - White (\"fast-twitch\") fibers have fewer mitochondria, are capable of more powerful (but shorter) contractions, metabolize ATP more quickly, have a lower capillary to volume ratio, and are more likely to accumulate lactic acid.

Fast fatigable motor units generate more force and have higher velocities than slow motor units, both because they have the highest number of fibers and because the individual fibers have the largest cross-sectional area (CSA) and the highest contractile velocity.

Studies show that bicarbonate loading strategies have a moderate positive effect on the performance of sports involving 1-7 min of sustained strenuous exercise, and may also be useful for prolonged sports involving intermittent or sustained periods of high-intensity work rates. This potential to enhance sports performance requires further investigation using appropriate research design, but may be limited by", "Does Sodium Citrate Cause the Same Ergogenic Effect As Sodium Bicarbonate on Swimming Performance?. Consumption of dietary sodium bicarbonate (SB) prior to exercise induces alkalosis by increasing blood bicarbonate pool and pH. This in turn enhances the buffering capacity of the extracellular space in the working muscle by influencing the efflux of the H+ into the extracellular space for disposal. During intensive submaximal exercise, one of the major cause of fatigue is believed to be metabolic acidosis caused by high rates of anaerobic glycolysis, which results in the accumulation of H+ ions in excess of intracellular buffering capacity.", "Does Sodium Citrate Cause the Same Ergogenic Effect As Sodium Bicarbonate on Swimming Performance?. We think that our results may be viewed from several aspects that have been questioned in recent literature. Are the metabolic conditions within 400 m freestyle swimming profitably affected?

Taken collectively, the above results emphasize the importance of exercise intensity for achieving the most favorable adaptations that delay muscle acidification and increase fatigue resistance.

Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) supplementation has been employed to improve performance in high-intensity activities, where the primary energy source is predominantly from the anaerobic glycolytic pathway (;;;, due to the greater need to buffer the hydrogen ions (H+) released by the dissociation of lactic acid molecules formed in large quantities in the sarcoplasm during high intensity exercise, causing the reduction of intramuscular pH and having a direct relation with the development of fatigue (; Fabiato and;;.

However, previous research is inconclusive on whether this may result in an attenuation of exercise-induced intramuscular acidosis. Still, it cannot be excluded that the elevated La\u2212 values also resulted from higher glyco(geno)lytic rate.", "Exogenous Ketosis Impairs 30-min Time-Trial Performance Independent of Bicarbonate Supplementation. Another factor that may affect performance during exogenous ketosis is dysregulation of acid\u2013base balance. We and others recently demonstrated that KE intake during exercise causes a mild acidosis (ketoacidosis), which in turn partly drains alkaline reserve because of blood HCO3\u2212 utilization. Although the causative role of extracellular H+ accumulation in the development of muscular fatigue remains controversial, there is clear evidence that such extracellular acidosis is ergolytic. Hence, we recently hypothesized that a potential ergogenic effect of KE may be overruled by ketosis-induced acid\u2013base dysregulation. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that counteracting KE-induced acidosis by concomitant oral bicarbonate (NaHCO3) ingestion increased mean power output during a 15-min TT at the end of a ~3-h simulated cycling race.

Conversely, in the conditions of the current study, blood pH and [HCO3\u2212] at the start of the TT30\u2032 were similar between KE + BIC and CON, which resulted in similar rates of HCO3\u2212 utilization during the TT30\u2032. Increased versus decreased extracellular HCO3\u2212 reserve stimulates versus impairs, respectively, the export of H+ and La\u2212 molecules from muscle cells.

CHAPTER SUMMARY The flow of intermediates through metabolic pathways is controlled by four regulatory mechanisms: 1) the availability of substrates, 2) allosteric activation and inhibition of enzymes, 3) covalent modification of enzymes, and 4) induction-repression of enzyme synthesis. In the absorptive state, the 2-to 4-hour period after ingestion of a meal, these mechanisms insure that available nutrients are captured as glycogen, triacylglycerol (TAG), and protein (Fig. 24.20). During this interval, transient increases in plasma glucose, amino acids, and TAG occur, the last primarily as components of chylomicrons synthesized by the intestinal mucosal cells.

ENZYME REGULATION The regulation of the reaction velocity of enzymes is essential if an organism is to coordinate its numerous metabolic processes. The rates of most enzymes are responsive to changes in substrate concentration, because the intracellular level of many substrates is in the range of the Km. Thus, an increase in substrate concentration prompts an increase in reaction rate, which tends to return the concentration of substrate toward normal. In addition, some enzymes with specialized regulatory functions respond to allosteric effectors and/or covalent modification or they show altered rates of enzyme synthesis (or degradation) when physiologic conditions are changed. A. Allosteric enzymes Allosteric enzymes are regulated by molecules called effectors that bind noncovalently at a site other than the active site. These enzymes are almost always", "its binding restores the energetically favorable monomer\u2013monomer contacts of a symmetric dimer (this also completely inactivates the enzyme).

In this view, ligand binding perturbs an all-or-none equilibrium between these two states, thereby changing the proportion of active molecules. Both models represent true and useful concepts.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another. This is often referred to as \"the lock and key\" model. However, while this model explains enzyme specificity, it fails to explain the stabilization of the transition state that enzymes achieve. The \"lock and key\" model has proven inaccurate and the induced fit model is the most currently accepted enzyme-substrate-coenzyme figure. ### Induced fit model In 1958 Daniel Koshland suggested a modification to the lock and key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continually reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site, the amino acid side chains which make up the active site are moulded", "result in \"part-of-the-sites binding (and reactivity)\", offer possible explanations why it may have a beneficial role in enzyme function, and point to experimental problems in documenting this behaviour. We describe some cases, for which such a mechanism was first reported and later disproved.

A majority of enzymes identified in this study as half-of-the-sites binding (or reactive) use it in the flip-flop version, in which \"half-of-the-sites\" refers to a particular moment in time. In general, the various variants of the mechanism seems to be employed often by oligomeric enzymes for allosteric regulation to enhance the efficiency of enzymatic reactions in many key metabolic pathways.", "a standard way to any other amino acid in the set; attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character.

The genetic code is the set of rules by which the information encoded within DNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) is translated into proteins. The information is contained in the mRNA sequence, combined into codons or nucleotide triplets. Each codon corresponds to either a specific amino acid or to a stop signal which terminates protein synthesis. With four different nucleotides and a code made of nucleotide triplets, there are 34 = 64 possibilities to code 20 amino acids and three stop codons. Consequently, modern genetic code is degenerated, or in other words, most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon.

Because of this redundancy, all but two amino acids are coded for by more than one triplet. Different organisms often show particular preferences for one of the several codons that encode the same given amino acid. How these preferences arise is a much debated area of molecular evolution. It is generally acknowledged that codon preferences reflect a balance", "of nucleic acid that is very similar to DNA, but whose monomers contain the sugar ribose rather than deoxyribose.

The genetic code specifies the correspondence during protein translation between codons and amino acids. The genetic code is nearly the same for all known organisms. ## RNA genes and genomes In some cases, RNA is an intermediate product in the process of manufacturing proteins from genes.

The presence of four different bases provides surprising genetic diversity. In the protein-coding regions of genes, the DNA bases are arranged into codons, a triplet of bases that specifies a particular amino acid. It is possible to arrange the four bases into 64 different triplet codons (43).

Because 64 codes are more than enough for 20 amino acids, most amino acids are coded by more than one codon.

After the potential has passed, the cell enters into a refractory period, to revert the potential to resting potential. To travel from one neuron to the next, the action potential must pass through the synapse. As the action potential travels down the axon, it triggers voltage regulated gates which allow Ca2+ ions to flow into the neuron.

Most cells will then carry out further reactions to 'repay' the used NAD+ and produce a final product of ethanol or lactic acid. Many bacteria use inorganic compounds as hydrogen acceptors to regenerate the NAD+. Cells performing aerobic respiration synthesize much more ATP, but not as part of glycolysis. These further aerobic reactions use pyruvate and NADH + H+ from glycolysis. Eukaryotic aerobic respiration produces approximately 34 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule, however most of these are produced by a vastly different mechanism to the substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis.

The process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, and makes energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced; however, two are consumed for the preparatory phase.

During the pay-off phase of glycolysis, four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP, and two NADH are produced when the triose sugars are oxidized. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. The overall reaction can be expressed this way: ## Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate The pyruvate produced in glycolysis is transported across the mitochondrial membranes by a membrane transport protein called the pyruvate carrier. The pyruvate decarboxylase then produces acetyl-CoA from pyruvate inside the mitochondrial matrix. This oxidation reaction also releases carbon dioxide as a product. In the process one molecule of NADH is formed per pyruvate oxidized. ## Citric Acid cycle This is also called the Krebs cycle or also the tricarboxylic acid cycle. When oxygen is", "Oxidation of the NADH and FADH2 by the ETC yields 14 ATP.

It is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown from glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondrion to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle. The product of this process is energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2.

After being converted to G6P, phosphoglucose mutase (isomerase) can turn the molecule into glucose-1-phosphate. Glucose-1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose. This reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate that is released in the reaction. Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of glycogen synthase. This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. It", "to glucose 6phosphate Glucose 1-phosphate, produced by glycogen phosphorylase, is isomerized in the cytosol to glucose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase (see Fig. 11.6). In the liver, glucose 6-phosphate is transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by glucose 6-phosphate translocase. There, it is dephosphorylated to glucose by glucose 6-phosphatase (the same enzyme used in the last step of gluconeogenesis; see p. 121). The glucose is then transported from the ER to the cytosol. Hepatocytes release glycogen-derived glucose into the blood to help maintain blood glucose levels until the gluconeogenic pathway is actively producing glucose. [Note: Muscle lacks glucose 6-phosphatase. Consequently, glucose 6-phosphate cannot be dephosphorylated and sent into the blood. Instead, it enters glycolysis, providing energy needed for muscle contraction.] D.

In liver, the phosphate is removed by glucose 6-phosphatase (an enzyme of the endoplasmic reticular membrane), releasing free glucose that can be used to maintain blood glucose levels at the beginning of a fast. A deficiency of the phosphatase causes glycogen storage disease Ia (von Gierke disease) and results in an inability of the liver to provide free glucose to the body during a fast. It affects both glycogen degradation and gluconeogenesis. Glycogen synthesis and degradation are reciprocally regulated to meet whole-body needs by the same hormonal signals (namely, an elevated insulin level results in overall increased glycogenesis and decreased glycogenolysis, whereas an elevated glucagon, or epinephrine, level causes the opposite effects).

In this case, it is the 1-carbon that is phosphorylated and the 6-carbon that is dephosphorylated. The resulting glucose-1-phosphate is then changed into UDP-glucose in a number of intermediate steps. If activated by insulin, glycogen synthase will proceed to clip the glucose from the UDP-glucose complex and on to the glycogen molecule. ## Disease Relevance Human muscle contains two phosphoglucomutases with nearly identical catalytic properties, PGM I and PGM II. One or the other of these forms is missing in some humans congenitally. Phosphoglucomutase deficiency is an extremely rare", "elongated by glycogen synthase. 2. Additional branch synthesis: After elongation of these two ends has been accomplished, their terminal six to eight glucosyl residues can be removed and used to make additional branches. IV. DEGRADATION (GLYCOGENOLYSIS) The degradative pathway that mobilizes stored glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle is not a reversal of the synthetic reactions. Instead, a separate set of cytosolic enzymes is required. When glycogen is degraded, the primary product is glucose 1-phosphate, obtained by breaking \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds. In addition, free glucose is released from each \u03b1(1\u21926)\u2013linked glucosyl residue (branch point). A.

The hydrolysis reaction can be viewed as the transfer of the phosphate group to water. subunits in the large branched polysaccharide glycogen, which is present as small granules in the cytoplasm of many cells, including liver and muscle. The synthesis and degradation of glycogen are rapidly regulated according to need. When cells need more ATP than they can generate from the food molecules taken in from the bloodstream, they break down glycogen in a reaction that produces glucose 1-phosphate, which is rapidly converted to glucose 6-phosphate for glycolysis (Figure 2\u201352).

The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates: - G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel. - G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars. - In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to Glucose by the enzyme Glucose 6-phosphatase. This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway.", "well as ribulose 5-phosphate, a carbon source for the synthesis of other molecules. Also, if the body needs nucleotide precursors of DNA for growth and synthesis, G6P will also be dehydrogenated and enter the pentose phosphate pathway. # Fate 2: Glycolysis If the cell needs energy or carbon skeletons for synthesis then glucose-6-phosphate is targeted for glycolysis. Glucose-6-phosphate is first isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase. This reaction converts glucose-6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in preparation for phosphorylation to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The addition of the 2nd phosphoryl group to produce Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an irreversible step, and so is used to irreversibly target the glucose-6-phosphate breakdown to provide energy for ATP production via glycolysis. # Fate 3: Storage as Glycogen If blood glucose levels are high, the body needs a way", "from point A to point B), insulin secretion increases.

As a consequence, the proteins will be separated according to their molecular weight. Electrophoresis of proteins can also be performed in the absence of SDS. Using such \"native\" conditions, the charge of each of the proteins, which will depend on the primary amino acid sequence of the protein (isoelectric point) and the pH during electrophoresis, will mainly influence the mobility of", "detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The reducing agent eliminates disulfide structures in the protein, and the SDS alters the surface charge of the protein. The end result is that the proteins in the sample are reduced to a globular shape whose cross-section is directly proportional to its molecular weight. These reduced proteins are then loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis (the PAGE of SDS-PAGE) and are then resolved as they migrate through the electric field according to the size of this globular shape.", "the individual protein molecules are released from their associations with other proteins or lipid molecules and rendered freely soluble in the detergent solution.

What happens when a mixture of SDS-solubilized proteins is run through a slab of polyacrylamide gel? Each protein molecule binds large numbers of the negatively charged detergent molecules, which mask the protein\u2019s intrinsic charge and cause it to migrate toward the positive electrode when a voltage is applied.

Nondenaturing or \"native\" electrophoresis (i.e., electrophoresis in the absence of denaturants such as detergents and urea) is an often-overlooked technique for determining the native size, subunit structure, and optimal separation of a protein.

The proteins are dissolved in a solution that includes a powerful negatively charged detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or SDS (Figure 8\u201312).

This is achieved using ATP generated by oxidative processes and, during intense activity, by anaerobic glycolysis.

During anaerobic exercise, the muscles being exercised have insufficient oxygen to meet the demands of the activity, and thus must also use alternate, non-oxygen-dependent processes to produce energy. The muscle does still receive oxygen during anaerobic exercise; the average drop in blood oxygen content throughout the body is likely minimal.

The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

Since this would inhibit ATPases, such as the myofibrillar acto-myosin ATPase and consequently muscle contraction, and many other cellular processes, nature has evolved a means to deal with the problem of the immediate replenishment of ATP stores.

If the nucleotide listed in the first column is present at the third, or wobble, position of the codon, it can base-pair with any of the nucleotides listed in the second column. Thus, for example, when inosine (I) is present in the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon, the tRNA can recognize any one of three different codons in bacteria and either of two codons in eukaryotes. The inosine in tRNAs is formed from the deamination of adenosine (see Figure 6\u201353),", "Codon usage bias Codons are triplets of nucleotides that together specify an amino acid residue in a polypeptide chain. Most organisms use 20 or 21 amino acids to make their polypeptides, which are proteins or protein precursors. Because there are four possible nucleotides, adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T) in DNA, there are 64 possible triplets to recognize only 20 amino acids plus the translation termination signal. Because of this redundancy, all but two amino acids are coded for by more than one triplet. Different organisms often show particular preferences for one of the several codons that encode the same given amino acid. How these preferences arise is a much debated area of molecular evolution. It is generally acknowledged that codon preferences reflect a balance", "System, it is classified as an antiviral. # Biotechnology When designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it can pair with adenine, thymine, or cytosine. This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer's annealing efficiency. However, inosine pairs preferentially with cytidine (C) and its introduction to RNA, e.g. by the action of ADARs, thereby destabilizes double stranded RNA by changing AU base-pairs to IU mismatches (Bass and Weintraub, Cell, 1988). # Fitness Despite lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements. # Feeding Stimulant Inosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some", "of the coded amino acids. Using a modified evolutionary optimization algorithm, we determined the conditions in which the effect on the relative codon usage is maximized. We found that the effect is enhanced by mutational processes generating more adenine and thymine than guanine and cytosine, as well as more purines than pyrimidines. Interestingly, this effect is observed only under an unrestricted model of nucleotide substitution, and disappears when the mutational process is time-reversible. Comparison of the simulation results with data for real protein coding sequences indicates that the impact of selection at the amino acid level on synonymous codon usage cannot be neglected.

Such a wide range of capabilities has emerged through the selection across fiber types of a narrow set of molecular characteristics suitable to achieve a specific contractile phenotype.

The oxidative capacity of the fast-twitch muscle fiber ranges from relatively high (in muscle fibers expressing type IIa myosin heavy chain) to low (in muscle fibers expressing type IIb myosin heavy chains). The low oxidative capacity of fast type IIb muscle fibers, coupled with the high myosin ATPase activity, increases the susceptibility of these muscle fibers to fatigue.

Their high levels of mitochondrial oxidative enzymes are demonstrated by their strong succinic dehydrogenase and NADH-TR histochemical staining reactions as described previously (see Fig. 11.3).

The oxidative ATP synthesis process characteristic of type I fibers is relatively slow to ramp up and can be sustained for long periods of time, making these motors units well-suited for sustained aerobic exercise such as distance running. Additionally, the low contraction velocity means that these slow motor units are also heavily recruited in precise finite motor activities and in opposing gravity. Fast fatigable motor units generate more force and have higher velocities than slow motor units, both because they have the highest number of fibers and because the individual fibers have the largest cross-sectional area (CSA) and the highest contractile velocity.

Fast muscle, in contrast, is recruited for activities that require faster movements, more force, or both (see Fig. 12.15 ). Weightlifting, for example, can require a lot of power for short duration. In order to meet the demands for more force, additional motor units are recruited. In comparison with slow motor units, the fast motor units typically contain more muscle fibers (see Table 12.2 ). Fast muscle fibers also have a larger diameter than do slow muscle fibers. Thus recruitment of fast motor units can help meet the increased demands of burst activities such as weightlifting.

Type IIb fibers predominate in the fast muscle of small mammals that have to accelerate their limbs very fast against little load. Human type IIx (aka IIB) are our fastest fibers.

The increase in force during tetanic contractions is due to prolonged elevation of intracellular [Ca++]. 5. The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity. In addition to the difference in myosin ATPase activity, fast-and slow-twitch muscles also differ in metabolic activity, fiber diameter, motor unit size, sensitivity to tetany, and recruitment pattern. 6.

Interestingly, the Warburg effect results in atypical metabolism, indicating that cancer cells mostly convert glucose into lactate even in the presence of oxygen.

The process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, and makes energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced; however, two are consumed for the preparatory phase. The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to destabilize the molecule for cleavage into two triose sugars.

Nearly all this ATP is produced by the mitochondrial ATP synthase. In Chapter 2, we introduced the concept of free energy (G). The free-energy change for a reaction, \u2206G, determines whether that reaction will occur in a cell. We showed on pp. 60\u201363 that the \u2206G for a given reaction can be written as the sum of two parts: the first, called the standard free-energy change, \u2206G\u00b0, depends only on the intrinsic characters of the reacting molecules; the second depends only on their concentrations.

This is a factor of 19 times more energy per sugar molecule than the typical anaerobic reaction generates. Eukaryotic organisms (everything but bacteria) only get a net gain of 36 ATP regenerated from ADP in this process, due to an additional membrane that must be crossed by active transport.

Many cases of leukemia arise through mutations that confer this capacity on committed hematopoietic precursor cells that would normally be fated to differentiate and die after a limited number of division cycles. The many types of blood cells, including erythrocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes, and macrophages, all derive from a common multipotent stem cell. In the adult, hematopoietic stem cells are found mainly in bone marrow, and they depend on signals from the marrow stromal (connective-tissue) cells to maintain their stem-cell character.

This, in effect, provides more energy to contracting muscles under heavy workloads. The production and removal of lactate from the cell also ejects a proton consumed in the LDH reaction- the removal of excess protons produced in the wake of this fermentation reaction serves to act as a buffer system for muscle acidosis. Once proton accumulation exceeds the rate of uptake in lactate production and removal through the LDH symport, muscular acidosis occurs. # Medical relevance LDH is a protein that normally appears", "Kinetic analysis and design of experiments to identify the catalytic mechanism of the monocarboxylate transporter isoforms 4 and 1. Transport of lactate, pyruvate, and other monocarboxylates across the sarcolemma of skeletal and cardiac myocytes occurs via passive diffusion and by monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) mediated transport. The flux of lactate and protons through the MCT plays an important role in muscle energy metabolism during rest and exercise and in pH regulation during exercise. The MCT isoforms 1 and 4 are the major isoforms of this transporter in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The current consensus on the mechanism of these transporters, based on experimental measurements of labeled lactate fluxes, is that monocarboxylate-proton symport occurs via a rapid-equilibrium ordered mechanism with proton binding followed by monocarboxylate binding. This study tests ordered", "= E. Vigorously contracting skeletal muscle shows an increase in the reduction of pyruvate to lactate compared with resting muscle.

The acidosis that is associated with increases in lactate concentration during heavy exercise arises from a separate reaction. When ATP is hydrolysed, a hydrogen ion is released. ATP-derived hydrogen ions are primarily responsible for the decrease in pH. During intense exercise, aerobic metabolism cannot produce ATP quickly enough to supply the demands of the muscle. As a result, anaerobic metabolism becomes the dominant energy producing pathway as it can form ATP at high rates.

This is because lactate itself is not capable of releasing a proton, and secondly, the acidic form of lactate, lactic acid, cannot be formed under normal circumstances in human tissues.

The cell then divides in cytokinesis, to produce two identical daughter cells. Because cytokinesis usually occurs in conjunction with mitosis, \"mitosis\" is often used interchangeably with \"mitotic phase\". However, there are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei.

The spindle is then disassembled, and the segregated chromosomes are packaged into separate nuclei at telophase.

Corresponding sister chromosomes attach at opposite ends of the cell. A new nuclear envelope, using fragments of the parent cell's nuclear membrane, forms around each set of separated sister chromosomes. Both sets of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclei, unfold back into chromatin. Mitosis is complete, but cell division is not yet complete. ## Cytokinesis Cytokinesis is often mistakenly thought to be the final part of telophase, however cytokinesis is a separate process that begins at the same time as telophase. Cytokinesis is technically not even a phase of mitosis, but rather a separate process, necessary for completing cell division.

Assortment and Segregation of Genes During Meiosis Meiosis occurs only in germ cells of the gonads.

In addition, there is active recombination that generates genetic diversity. During the first cell division,", "Anaphase B: Long-standing models meet new concepts. Anaphase B is a very robust phase of mitosis that relies on the multiple distinct and coordinated mechanisms to accomplish the crucial task of chromosome segregation. We reason this is due to the fact that anaphase represents the final point in the mitotic process, where after satisfaction of complex survey mechanisms that ensure proper connections between MTs and chromosomes, the cell must achieve sufficient chromosome segregation before onset of chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope reformation and furrow ingression. The final result is two daughter cells with an equal number of chromosomes. In that regard, anaphase is not only adapted to precision rather than to speed but it is also highly robust and characterized by redundancy to achieve effective separation of sister chromatids", "a pair of daughter nuclei; and cytoplasmic division, or cytokinesis, when the cell itself divides in two (Figure 17\u20132). At the end of S phase, the DNA molecules in each pair of duplicated chromosomes are intertwined and held tightly together by specialized protein linkages. Early in mitosis at a stage called prophase, the two DNA molecules are gradually disentangled and condensed into pairs of rigid, compact rods called sister chromatids, which remain linked by sister-chromatid cohesion. When the nuclear envelope disassembles later in mitosis, the sister-chromatid pairs become attached to the mitotic spindle, a giant bipolar array of microtubules (discussed in Chapter 16). Sister chromatids are attached to opposite poles of the spindle and, eventually, align at the spindle equator in a stage called metaphase.

Telophase - The stage of mitosis when the nucleus reforms and chromosomes unravel into longer chromatin structures for reentry into interphase. - Prophase - The stage of mitosis in which the chromatin condenses into a highly ordered structure called chromosomes and the nuclear membrane begins to breakup. - Metaphase - The stage of mitosis in which condensed chromosomes, carrying genetic information, align in the", "(centrioles) at each pole. The new equatorial metaphase plate is rotated by 90 degrees when compared to meiosis I, perpendicular to the previous plate. This is followed by anaphase II, where the centromeres are cleaved, allowing microtubules attached to the kinetochores to pull the sister chromatids apart. The sister chromatids by convention are now called sister chromosomes as they move toward opposing poles. The process ends with telophase II, which is similar to telophase I, and is marked by uncoiling and lengthening of the chromosomes and the disappearance of the spindle.

Certain cells, such as cardiac muscle cells, are highly permeable to lactate. Lactate is converted into pyruvate and metabolised normally (ie: via the citric acid cycle). Since these cells are highly oxygenated, it is unlikely that lactate would accumulate (as is the case in oxygen-starved muscle cells). This also allows circulating glucose to be available to muscle cells. Any excess lactate is taken up by the liver,", "A lactatic perspective on metabolism. The cell-to-cell lactate shuttle was introduced in 1984 and has been repeatedly supported by studies using a variety of experimental approaches. Because of its large mass and metabolic capacity, skeletal muscle is probably the major component of the lactate shuttle in terms of both production and consumption. Muscles exercising in a steady state are avid consumers of lactate, using most of the lactate as an oxidative fuel. Cardiac muscle is highly oxidative and readily uses lactate as a fuel. Lactate is a major gluconeogenic substrate for the liver; the use of lactate to form glucose increases when blood lactate concentration is elevated. Illustrative of the widespread shuttling of lactate, even the brain takes up lactate when the blood level is increased. Recently, an", "the least from the Copenhagen School in the 1930s, in the metabolic role of lactate in skeletal muscle.

The synthesis of lactate may be diminished via L-citrulline supplementation because it buffers ammonia through the urea cycle, thereby enhancing the aerobic utilization of pyruvate. Second, L-citrulline in the kidney can be converted to L-arginine, which is a substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Unlike L-arginine, L-citrulline bypasses the intestinal or hepatic elimination. Oral L-citrulline supplementation can increase plasma L-arginine concentrations and amplify NO-dependent signaling in a dose-dependent manner. Indeed, previous studies have shown that citrulline supplementation increased blood NO levels and plasma arginine availability for NO synthesis.

The objection to the idea of a major role for lactate in energy metabolism beyond just being a waste product or, at best, a minor player, is understandable. The dogma of glucose\u2019s obligatory role in energy metabolism in all tissues, organs, and most aerobic organisms is an inseparable part of our understanding and acceptance of this process as formulated during the first half of the twentieth century. However, a trove of experimental data have emerged over the past quarter of a century, all pointing to a major role for lactate in oxidative energy metabolism in brain, skeletal muscle, heart, and probably many other mammalian", "in the ability to excrete acid via the kidneys. Renal acidosis is associated with an accumulation of urea and creatinine as well as metabolic acid residues of protein catabolism. An increase in the production of metabolic acids may also produce metabolic acidosis. For example, lactic acidosis may occur from 1) severe (PaO2 <36mm Hg) hypoxemia causing a fall in the rate of oxygen diffusion from arterial blood to tissues, or 2) hypoperfusion (e.g. hypovolemic shock) causing an inadequate blood delivery of oxygen to tissues.

A reverse of the alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in liver. Pyruvate regenerated forms glucose through gluconeogenesis, which returns to muscle through the circulation system. Glutamate in the liver enters mitochondria and degrades into ammonium ion through the action of glutamate dehydrogenase, which in turn participate in the urea cycle to form urea. Glucose-alanine cycle enables pyruvate and glutamate to be removed from muscle and find their ways to liver. Glucose is able to be regenerated from pyruvate and returned muscle. The energetic burden of gluconeogenesis is thus imposed on the liver instead of the muscle.

The initial response to the onset of exercise is enhancement of sympathoadrenal activity and secretion of pituitary hormones, which result in a reduction in the plasma concentration of insulin and a rise in that of virtually all other hormones. Because of this shift in hormone balance, a modification of the metabolism of intra- and extra-muscular triglycerides and glycogen as fuels for muscular exercise occurs.

Glycogen phosphorylase kinase activates glycogen phosphorylase in the same manner mentioned previously. Glycogen phosphorylase b is not always inactive in muscle, as it can be activated allosterically by AMP. An increase in AMP concentration, which occurs during strenuous exercise, signals energy demand. AMP activates glycogen phosphorylase b by changing its conformation from a tense to a relaxed form. This relaxed form has similar enzymatic properties as the phosphorylated enzyme. An increase in ATP concentration opposes this activation by displacing AMP from the nucleotide binding site, indicating sufficient energy stores. Upon eating a meal, there is a release of insulin, signaling glucose availability in the blood. Insulin indirectly activates PP-1 and phosphodiesterase.

Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a ' 'secure base' 'to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. The human infant is considered by attachment theorists to have a need for a secure relationship with adult caregivers, without which normal social and emotional development will not occur.", "An exploratory study on how attachment classifications manifest in group psychotherapy. Before becoming a popular framework for psychotherapy, attachment theory began as a theory of the development of close relationships and personality (Bowlby, 1969/1982). The core tenets of this theory can be encapsulated in two main assumptions. First, Bowlby hypothesized that one of the basic needs of the individual, in childhood as in adulthood, is to maintain an unbroken relationship with one or more persons who are stronger and wiser, called attachment figures. According to Bowlby, this need evolved in many species because maintaining proximity to a caregiver increases the likelihood that the infant will be protected from dangers. After infancy, many other strategies can be used to fulfil the need for protection and safety. For example, adults", "Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the first many children have more than one figure towards whom they direct attachment behaviour; these figures are not treated alike and there is a strong bias for attachment behaviour to become directed mainly towards one particular person. This bias to attach especially to one figure Bowlby called \"monotropy\". This concept has been effectively abandoned insofar as it may be taken to mean that the relationship with the special figure differs qualitatively from that of other figures. Rather there are seen to be definite hierarchies. According to Mary Main (1999), \"although there is general agreement that an infant", "The limits of the attachment network. From the beginning, theories of attachment and caregiving have given rise to questions about minimum and maximum numbers of attachment figures. The child's tendency to direct attachment behavior to a specific figure rather than to whoever is nearby has led to the idea of monotropy, suggesting that a child would thrive best with one special attachment figure. From an evolutionary perspective kinship caregiving networks are more plausible as they would increase the chances of survival, and in hunter-gatherer and agricultural communities paternal care and kinship networks providing care for young children were indeed common. A recent development in cultural evolution is the invention of organized day care and children's homes and institutions. Although the attachment network may increase in size with the", "necessarily being displayed behaviourally, and it may be impossible to measure the presence of this attitude without creating some apparently threatening circumstance such as the approach of an unfamiliar person. Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present and diminished in their absence. With the attachment figure present the infant's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore. If the caregiver is inaccessible or unresponsive, attachment behaviour is strongly activated. During the period of 6 months to two years period the child's behaviour towards the caregiver becomes organised on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make him feel secure. With the development of locomotion the infant begins to use his carer(s) as a safe base from which to explore. In adolescents, the role", "Mother-child bonding assessment tools\u2606\n.

These children also use familiar people as a \"secure base\" and return to them periodically when exploring a new situation. Such children are said to have a secure attachment style, and characteristically continue to develop well both cognitively and emotionally. Smaller numbers of children show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, they appear to be on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships.

Next, the ACTH circulates throughout the blood and acts on the adrenal glands to release the steroid hormone cortisol. The increased circulating cortisol levels cause an increase in blood pressure as well as a rise in blood glucose concentrations to serve as the fuel for the muscular reactions required in the response.

The secretion of the complex is influenced by various central inhibitory and excitatory nervous pathways. The releasing factor is conveyed by the hypophyseal portal vessels to the adenohypophysis where it stimulates the secretion of ACTH.

The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy.

In steady-state contractile activity below the maximal, graded levels of high-energy phosphates and of cellular respiration are achieved in both fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles. Within the metabolic range up to the maximal aerobic capacity, which differs several-fold for different fibre types, this gradation is mediated by the creatine kinase reaction and phosphocreatine stores. Thus while the amount of enzyme present and the content of phosphocreatine differs among muscles of different types, the same general energetic function is seen to occur in all muscle cells. The creatine kinase reaction is both an energy reservoir and a buffer preventing large swings in the ATP/ADP ratios.", "ATP hydrolysis # Overview ATP hydrolysis is the reaction by which chemical energy that has been stored and transported in the high-energy phosphoanhydridic bonds in ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) is released, for example in the muscles, to produce work. The product is ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) and an inorganic phosphate, orthophosphate (Pi). ADP can be further hydrolyzed to give energy, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate), and another orthophosphate (Pi). ATP hydrolysis is the final link between the energy derived from food or sunlight and useful work such as muscle contraction, the establishment of ion gradients across membranes, and biosynthetic processes necessary to maintain life. Hydrolysis of the phosphate groups in ATP is especially exergonic, because the resulting orthophosphate group is greatly stabilized by multiple resonance structures, making the products (ADP and Pi)", "The creatine kinase system and pleiotropic effects of creatine. Although ATP represents the universal energy currency in all organisms and cells, ATP levels are not simply up-regulated in cells with high and/or intermittently fluctuating energy demand. Elevation of the intracellular ATP concentration [ATP], as an immediate energy reserve, followed by its hydrolysis, would lead to a massive accumulation of ADP plus Pi and also liberate H+, acidifying the cytosol. Since this would inhibit ATPases, such as the myofibrillar acto-myosin ATPase and consequently muscle contraction, and many other cellular processes, nature has evolved a means to deal with the problem of the immediate replenishment of ATP stores. The so-called phosphagens evolved as high-energy compounds that are \u201cmetabolically inert\u201d and as such do not interfere with primary metabolism. One of", "The presence of this energy buffer system keeps the ATP/ADP ratio high at subcellular places where ATP is needed, which ensures that the free energy of ATP remains high and minimizes the loss of adenosine nucleotides, which would cause cellular dysfunction. Such high-energy phosphate buffers in the form of phosphocreatine or phosphoarginine are known as phosphagens. In addition, due to the presence of subcompartmentalized Creatine Kinase Isoforms at specific sites of the cell, the phosphocreatine/creatine kinase system also acts as an intracellular energy transport system from those places where ATP is generated (mitochondria and glycolysis) to those places where energy is needed and used, e.g. at the myofibrils for muscle contraction, at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) for calcium pumping and many more biological processes which depend on ATP.", "the transfer of their phosphate groups to ADP. In the citric acid cycle, one guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (which can donate a phosphate group to ADP or UDP, forming the respective triphosphates (a near equilibrium reaction catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphate kinase)) is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation (per cycle, with 2 cycles per glucose molecule) when succinyl-CoA synthetase converts succinyl-CoA to succinate. Substrate-level phosphorylation is also seen in working skeletal muscles and the brain. Phosphocreatine is stored as a readily available high-energy phosphate supply, and the enzyme creatine phosphokinase transfers a phosphate from phosphocreatine to ADP to produce ATP. Then the ATP releases giving chemical energy. An alternative way to create ATP is through oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place during the process of aerobic cellular respiration, in addition to the", "includes 22 +/- 8 max acceleration efforts. Human physiology relies on the energy stored in one of the phosphate bonds in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to power all activities. Breaking this bond changes ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) which must then be converted back to ATP by one of the three main energy systems: phosphocreatine (ATP-Pcr), glycolytic, and aerobic. The cardiopulmonary system plays a key role in supplying the required energy resources and shuttling off by-products such as carbon dioxide, lactate and H+ ions. The following section briefly outlines some of the key considerations for the various energy systems.", "Fueling thought: Management of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in neuronal metabolism. Finally, why might neurons temporarily allow glycolysis to exceed oxphos in the face of acute energy demand? One speculation is that glycolysis, although it produces a lower yield of ATP than oxphos, provides a faster resupply of energy. Some evolutionary support for this speculation comes from muscle: fast-twitch muscle, requiring the greatest acute supply of energy, tends to be far more glycolytic and to have fewer mitochondria than the slow-twitch muscle used for postural control (;. Neurons possess many mitochondria and rely chronically on them as a major source of ATP, but perhaps, like fast-twitch muscle fibers, they use glycolysis together with the formidable and fast phosphocreatine/creatine kinase system to ensure prompt resupply of ATP.

Recent large-scale RNA sequencing efforts have revealed the extensive diversity of mRNA molecules produced from most eukaryotic coding genes, which arises from the usage of alternative, cryptic or non-canonical splicing and intronic polyadenylation sites. The prevailing view regarding the tremendous diversity of coding gene transcripts is that mRNA processing is a flexible and more-or-less noisy process leading to a diversity of proteins on which natural selection can act depending on protein-mediated cellular functions. However, this concept raises two main questions. First, do alternative mRNA processing pathways have a role other than generating mRNA and protein diversity?

In addition, some DNA segments\u2014a smaller number\u2014are transcribed into RNA molecules that are not translated but have catalytic, regulatory, or structural functions; such DNA segments also count as genes.

Genes often contain regions that do not encode products, but regulate gene expression. The genes of eukaryotic organisms can contain regions called introns that are removed from the messenger RNA in a process called splicing. The regions encoding gene products are called exons. In eukaryotes, a single gene can encode multiple proteins, which are produced through the creation of different arrangements of exons through alternative splicing.

The general model of gene expression implies that the units of genetic information, the genes, constitute the basis of the mRNA and protein products detected in living organisms.

In contrast to the typically streamlined genomes of prokaryotes, many eukaryotic genomes are riddled with long intergenic regions, spliceosomal introns, and repetitive elements.

There are three general hypotheses: (1) the structures in question are not actually suboptimal but optimal, being favored by selection, for unknown reasons; (2) the structures are not suboptimal, but of (essentially) equal fitness to \"optimal\" ones; or (3) the structures are truly suboptimal, but selection is too weak to systematically eliminate them.

Because only euchromatin permits gene expression and thereby dictates cellular identity and activity, there are a host of mechanisms that tightly regulate the state of chromatin (described below).

Transcriptionally active, decondensed chromatin (euchromatin) differs from the more condensed, inactive form (heterochromatin) in a number of ways. Active chromatin contains histone proteins that have been covalently modified at their amino terminal ends by reversible methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation (see p. 438 for a discussion of histone acetylation/deacetylation by histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase).

Simply put, by establishing and maintaining the structural state of the chromatin, epigenetic processes regulate the ease in which transcription factors and other proteins can access their DNA substrates. For example, the amino acid \u201ctails\u201d of histone proteins are subjected to various post-translational modifications (eg, acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation) that render the chromatin relatively compact and transcriptionally inactive (ie, heterochromatin) or less compact and transcriptionally active (ie, euchromatin).

The electrostatic affinity is effectively decreased to relax the higher order of the chromatin condensation. Therefore, transcriptional factors and the RNA polymerase II are allowed to bind to the DNA to promote the transcription. On the other hand, histone deacetylation condenses the chromatin by packing up the DNA and terminates the transcriptional activities. Remarkably, applying ChIP-seq technology is able to predict the heterologous density distribution of nucleosomes. Compared with the upstream regions of the inert gene, the density of the nucleosome of activated genes is significantly downregulated.

Most actively transcribed genes are found in a relatively decondensed form of chromatin called euchromatin, whereas most inactive segments of DNA are found in highly condensed heterochromatin. The interconversion of these forms is called chromatin remodeling. A major component of chromatin remodeling is the covalent modification of histones (for example, the acetylation of lysine residues at the amino terminus of histone proteins), as shown in Figure 31.11. Acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HAT), eliminates the positive charge on the lysine, thereby decreasing the interaction of the histone with the negatively charged DNA.

Transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase can be regulated by at least five mechanisms: - Specificity factors alter the specificity of RNA polymerase for a given promoter or set of promoters, making it more or less likely to bind to them (i.e. sigma factors used in prokaryotic transcription). - Repressors bind to non-coding sequences on the", "interphase The structure of chromatin during interphase is optimised to allow easy access of transcription and DNA repair factors to the DNA while compacting the DNA into the nucleus.

In particular, it is believed that measurement of muscle metabolites could provide relevant information regarding anaerobic metabolism. However, determination of the maximum amount of ATP that can be resynthesized by breakdown of phosphocreatine and intramuscular glycogen, using small muscle biopsy samples, can result in a limited representation of anaerobic metabolism activation in all the muscles recruited during exercise.

Although the first solution would appear to be simpler, it is limited by the laws of physics, since if the water level is more than eight meters down, the pump can no longer operate. 23 The static level of the water table, then, will influence the choice of pump. The second criterion concerns the method of operating the pump: -manually (hand pump) -by an external energy source, such as wind, electricity, or sun. The factors to be considered in this choice are as follows: 27 the temptation is to install powerful technical means to provide maximum flow.

Nodal pressure was far more relevant than the other two peak and average water demand hours since leakage and water quality worsened significantly during this low consumption hour. Figure 2 depicted the variation in demand and pressure across a 24-hour simulated period. As observed from Figure 2 the demand and pressure at each node have inverse relationship. When the demand was higher the pressure becomes reduced and vice versa. At 18:00 PM, the simulation is illustrated by a bolded vertical line demand and pressure relationship. As can be seen from this vantage point, demand was low but pressure was high.

In most situations, this specification should achieve a negative pressure of at least 0.001 inch of water. If the minimum 0.001 inch of water is not achieved and cannot be achieved by increasing the flow differential (within the limits of the ventilation system), the room should be inspected for leakage (e.g., through doors, windows, plumbing, and equipment wall penetrations), and corrective action should be taken to seal the leaks. Negative pressure in a room can be altered by changing the ventilation system operation or by the opening and closing of the room's doors, corridor doors, or windows. When an operating configuration has been established, it is essential that all doors and windows remain properly closed in", "including the airflow path and flow openings. If the room is well sealed, negative pressures greater than the minimum of 0.001 inch of water may be readily achieved. However, if rooms are not well sealed, as may be the case in many facilities (especially older facilities), achieving higher negative pressures may require exhaust/supply flow differentials beyond the capability of the ventilation system. To establish negative pressure in a room that has a normally functioning ventilation system, the room supply and exhaust airflows are first balanced to achieve an exhaust flow of either 10% or 50 cubic feet per minute (cfm) greater than the supply (whichever is the greater).

As electrons are passed down the ETC, they lose much of their free energy. This energy is used to move H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a H+ gradient that drives the production of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), described on p. 77.

Most diabetics know when they're going to \"go hypo\" and usually are able to eat some food or drink something sweet to raise levels. A patient who is hyperglycemic (high glucose) can also become temporarily hypoglycemic, under certain conditions (e.g. not eating regularly, or after strenuous exercise, followed by fatigue).

The exercise regimen should also include resistance training. Despite its benefits, exercise presents challenges for individuals with DM because they lack the normal glucoregulatory mechanisms (normally, insulin falls and glucagon rises during exercise). Skeletal muscle is a major site for metabolic fuel consumption in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, aerobic exercise greatly increases fuel requirements. Individuals with type 1 DM are prone to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia during exercise, depending on the preexercise plasma glucose, the circulating insulin level, and the level of exercise-induced catecholamines.", "does not reduce insulin level enough during the activity to adequately attenuate hypoglycemia risk (88). A more aggressive basal rate reduction, such as basal rate suspension at exercise onset is somewhat effective, although blood glucose levels may still drop markedly at the start of exercise (79).

For people on insulin injections, in addition to lowering the mealtime bolus before exercise, exercise-associated hypoglycemia can be attenuated by reducing total daily basal insulin by 20% for days when they are physically active (89).

In addition to the true repair pathways, the postreplication repair pathway allows lesions or structural aberrations that block replicative DNA polymerases to be tolerated.

For one thing, the translesion polymerases lack exonucleolytic proofreading activity; in addition, many are much less discriminating than the replicative polymerase in choosing which nucleotide to incorporate initially.

This error rate is over 100,000 times greater than that in DNA replication, where, as we have seen, a series of proofreading processes makes the process unusually accurate (Table 5\u20131). Only DNA Replication in the 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 Direction Allows Efficient Error Correction The need for accuracy probably explains why DNA replication occurs only in the 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 direction.

Finally, unlike DNA polymerases, which make their products in segments that are later stitched together, RNA polymerases are absolutely processive; that is, the same RNA polymerase that begins an RNA molecule must finish it without dissociating from the DNA template.

Sodium, potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl-) ions are reabsorbed by active transport.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our goal is to suggest how the renal concentrating mechanism is regulated in vivo. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of descending thin limbs of the loop of Henle lack aquaporin-1 water channels, and loops of Henle in the inner medulla lack urea transporters. SUMMARY: Lack of water permeability in the descending thin limbs of the loop of Henle offers several advantages. First, since much less water is added to the outer medullary interstitial compartment, inhibitory control mechanisms on sodium and chloride reabsorption from the medullary thick ascending of loop of Henle initiated by water addition from the medullary collecting duct can be effective. Second, recycling of urea is efficient, as little urea will be washed out of the medulla.", "Thin ascending limb of loop of Henle\n\n# Overview\nAs the filtrate passes back up the thin ascending limb of loop of Henle, the concentration of the surrounding medulla decreases.

Cl diffuses into the interstitium following its concentration gradient through Cl conducting channels. Although the energy from ATP is required to open these channels, the movement of Cl is not an example of active transport and does not require Cl -stimulated ATPase activity. Counter ions, in this case Na (the majority) and K, follow passively to maintain electrochemical neutrality. The hyperosmolarity of the interstitium is directly related to the transport activity of the cells in this limb of the loop of Henle. Further, the thin ascending limb is largely impermeable to water, so that at this site, as the salt concentration increases in the interstitium, the interstitium becomes hyperosmotic and the fluid in the lumen of the nephron becomes hyposmotic. In addition,", "ascending limb of the loop of Henle begins at the deeper portion of the renal outer medulla. Here, the urine has a relatively high concentration of sodium. As urine moves towards the more superficial portion of the thick ascending limb, NKCC2 is the major transport protein by which sodium is reabsorbed from the urine. This outward movement of sodium and the lack of water permeability in the thick ascending limb, creates a more diluted urine. According to the stoichiometry outlined above, each molecule of sodium reabsorbed brings one molecule of potassium and two molecules of chloride. Sodium goes on to be reabsorbed into the blood, where it contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure. Furosemide and other loop diuretics inhibit the activity of NKCC2, thereby impairing sodium reabsorption", "The renal concentrating mechanism and the clinical consequences of its loss. After tubular fluid passes through the tip of Henle's loop, tubular fluid osmolality decreases progressively in the ascending parts of the loop. In contrast to water permeability in the thin descending limb of Henle, which is high, water permeability in the ascending segments of Henle's loop is exceedingly low regardless of plasma vasopressin level. Furthermore, the ascending segments of the limb of Henle have high permeabilities for the solutes making up the bulk of the osmotic concentration in the tubular fluid in these segments (chloride, sodium, urea), and possess, at least in the thick ascending limb of Henle, potent mechanisms of solute transfer, such as the apical NKCC2 channel (Na-K-2CI cotransporter).

Salt reabsorption in the TAL therefore dilutes the tubular fluid, and for this reason, the TAL is called a diluting segment. Medullary portions of the TAL contribute to medullary hypertonicity and thereby also play an important role in concentration of urine by the collecting duct. The NaCl transport system in the luminal membrane of the TAL is a Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter (called NKCC2 or NK2CL) (Figure 15\u20133). This transporter is selectively blocked by diuretic agents known as \u201cloop\u201d diuretics (discussed later in chapter). Although the Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 transporter is itself electrically neutral (two cations and two anions are cotransported), the action of the transporter contributes to excess K+ accumulation within the cell.
