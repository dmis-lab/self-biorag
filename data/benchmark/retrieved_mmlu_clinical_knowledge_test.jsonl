Initial investigations should always focus on finding any treatable cause for dementia such as HIV, structural lesions such as subdural haematomas or specific nutritional deficiency states such as that due to vitamin B12 and treated appropriately.

Secondary dementias are those caused by, or closely related to, some other recognizable disease, such as HIV, head injury, multiple sclerosis, thyroid disorders or vitamin B12 deficiency.

This terminology refers to the molecular level of respiration, not the respiration of the organism as a whole (i.e., breathing). During anaerobic exercise, the muscles being exercised have insufficient oxygen to meet the demands of the activity, and thus must also use alternate, non-oxygen-dependent processes to produce energy. The muscle does still receive oxygen during anaerobic exercise; the average drop in blood oxygen content throughout the body is likely minimal.

Arterial pH remains within normal values during moderate exercise. During strenuous exercise, arterial pH begins to fall as lactic acid is liberated from muscles during anaerobic metabolism. This decrease in arterial pH stimulates ventilation that is out of proportion to the level of exercise.

METHOD: A thorough interview concerning the onset of symptoms, invariability, and subjective perception is mandatory. The first step before examining ocular motility is to verify monocular or binocular double vision. When the reported diplopia is binocular, the examiner can carry out the red-glass test to determine the site of the double image. In a next step monocular range of movement in the 9 directions of gaze is evaluated to search for incomitance.

For patients presenting to an outpatient facility, diagnoses are rarely serious. However, potentially life-threatening causes (predominantly stroke or transient ischemic attack) can be encountered. In patients presenting with diplopia related to isolated cranial nerve palsy, immediate neuroimaging can often be avoided if an appropriate history and examination are used to exclude worrisome etiologies.

The diagnosis of an acquired vertical strabismus is not always straightforward. There is no one specific test that will diagnose a vertical deviation. The clinical presentation, signs, and symptoms are the driving forces that will help lead to the correct diagnosis. Patients with binocular vertical diplopia may have symptoms of recent onset or that have been long-standing. Others may not even be completely aware that their ocular symptoms are attributable to a doubled vertical image. The differential diagnosis for vertical diplopia includes oculomotor nerve palsy, superior oblique palsy, restrictive ophthalmopathies, myasthenia gravis, and skew deviation.

Because of this redundancy, all but two amino acids are coded for by more than one triplet. Different organisms often show particular preferences for one of the several codons that encode the same given amino acid. How these preferences arise is a much debated area of molecular evolution. It is generally acknowledged that codon preferences reflect a balance", "of nucleic acid that is very similar to DNA, but whose monomers contain the sugar ribose rather than deoxyribose. RNA also contains the base uracil in place of thymine. RNA molecules are less stable than DNA and are typically single-stranded. Genes that encode proteins are composed of a series of three-nucleotide sequences called codons, which serve as the \"words\" in the genetic \"language\". The genetic code specifies the correspondence during protein translation between codons and amino acids. The genetic code is nearly the same for all known organisms. ## RNA genes and genomes In some cases, RNA is an intermediate product in the process of manufacturing proteins from genes.

The presence of four different bases provides surprising genetic diversity. In the protein-coding regions of genes, the DNA bases are arranged into codons, a triplet of bases that specifies a particular amino acid. It is possible to arrange the four bases into 64 different triplet codons (43). Each codon specifies 1 of the 20 different amino acids, or a regulatory signal such as initiation and stop of translation.

Specific nucleotide triplets, called codons, on the mRNA determine the start, the stop or the addition of an amino acid, leading to the creation of a polypeptide chain. Then a transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying the anticodon sequence (complementary to the codon on the mRNA) and a corresponding amino acid, binds to the codon on the mRNA and delivers the new amino acid to extend the polypeptide being synthesized. The maximum number of combinations of three bases out of four is theoretically 43=64 (Table ). Except for one specific codon (AUG) that initiates the translation of mRNA into protein and 3 codons (UGA, UAG, UAA) that stop translation, 61 out of the 64 triplets encode 20 different", "mRNA language of adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U).

Therefore, 64 different combinations of bases exist, taken three at a time (a triplet code), as shown in the table in Figure 32.2. many common amino acids are shown as examples. 1. How to translate a codon: This table can be used to translate any codon and, thus, to determine which amino acids are coded for by an mRNA sequence. For example, the codon AUG codes for methionine ([Met] see Fig. 32.2). [Note: AUG is the initiation (start) codon for translation.] Sixty-one of the 64 codons code for the 20 standard amino acids", "of a gene, through the intermediary of mRNA, is instead translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein by rules that are known as the genetic code.

RNA is a linear polymer of four different nucleotides, so there are 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 = 64 possible combinations of three nucleotides: the triplets AAA, AUA, AUG, and so on. However, only 20 different amino acids are commonly found in proteins. Either some nucleotide triplets are never used, or the code is redundant and some amino acids are specified by more than one triplet. The second possibility is, in fact, the correct one, as shown", "next. Because of this decoding, the information carried on mRNA relies on tRNA. Translation involves all three RNAs. The precise transfer of information from mRNA to protein is governed by genetic code, the set of rules by which codons are translated into an amino acid (Table 15-2). A codon, a triplet of three bases, codes for one amino acid. In this case, random combinations of the four bases form 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4, or 64 codes.

Long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria: After a LCFA enters a cell, it is converted in the cytosol to its CoA derivative by long-chain fatty acyl CoA synthetase (thiokinase), an enzyme of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Because \u03b2-oxidation occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, the fatty acid must be transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is impermeable to CoA. Therefore, a specialized carrier transports the long-chain acyl group from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix. This carrier is carnitine, and this rate-limiting transport process is called the carnitine shuttle (Fig. 16.16). a.

During starvation, cells must typically shift from growth to survival mode and alter metabolism towards functions important for viability. Instead of shipping acetyl units out to the cytosol, there is now a greater requirement for acetyl-CoA to be oxidized in the mitochondria for ATP synthesis (Fig. 1). Under such conditions, nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA levels therefore decrease. Fatty acids are a significant source of this mitochondrial acetyl-CoA pool []. CoA synthesis is induced to activate fatty acids as fatty acyl-CoAs], which can then be transported into mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle for \u03b2-oxidation. As a result, acetyl-CoA is generated in the mitochondria for oxidation or other possible fates. In the liver, mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is used to synthesize ketone bodies (acetoacetate and", "binding to the carnitine molecule to form acyl-carnitine. The free fatty acid in the cytosol is attached with a thioester bond to coenzyme A (CoA). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and driven to completion by inorganic pyrophosphatase. The acyl group on CoA can now be transferred to carnitine and the resulting acyl-carnitine transported into the mitochondrial matrix. This occurs via a series of similar steps: - Acyl-CoA is conjugated to carnitine by carnitine acyltransferase I (palmitoyltransferase) located on the outer mitochondrial membrane - Acyl-carnitine is shuttled inside by a carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase - Acyl-carnitine is converted to acyl-CoA by carnitine acyltransferase II (palmitoyltransferase) located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The liberated carnitine returns to the cytosol. Dysfunction of this process leads to the genetic", "liver and kidneys. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is essential to the synthesis of carnitine. It has been speculated that during growth or pregnancy the requirement of carnitine could exceed its natural production. # Role in fatty acid metabolism Carnitine transports long-chain acyl groups from fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, so that they can be broken down through beta-oxidation to acetate to obtain usable energy via the citric acid cycle. In some organisms such as fungi, the acetate is used in the glyoxylate cycle for gluconeogenesis and formation of carbohydrates. Fatty acids must be activated before binding to the carnitine molecule to form acyl-carnitine. The free fatty acid in the cytosol is attached with a thioester bond to coenzyme A (CoA). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme", "by carnitine. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, fatty acyl-carnitine reacts with coenzyme A to release the fatty acid and produce acetyl-CoA. CPT-I is believed to be the rate limiting step in fatty acid oxidation. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, fatty acids undergo \u03b2-oxidation. During this process, two-carbon molecules acetyl-CoA are repeatedly cleaved from the fatty acid. Acetyl-CoA can then enter the TCA cycle, which produces NADH and FADH. NADH and FADH are subsequently used in the electron transport chain to produce ATP, the energy currency of the cell. # Synthesis # Regulation and control It has long been held that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is the enzyme that hydrolyses triacylglycerides to free fatty acids from fats (lipolysis).

The fatty acid is firstly bound to CoA and may cross the external mitochondrial membrane. It then exchanges the CoA for carnitine by the action of the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. The complex then enters the mitochondrial matrix via facilitated diffusion by carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. Here, the acyl-carnitine complex is disrupted by carnitine palmitoyltransferase II and the fatty acid rebinds to CoA. Carnitine then diffuses back across the membrane by carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This is called the carnitine shuttle system. # Clinical significance A disorder is associated with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase", "the acyl group is transferred from CoA to carnitine by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), an enzyme of the outer mitochondrial membrane.

Second, the acylcarnitine is transported into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for free carnitine by carnitine\u2013acylcarnitine translocase. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT-II, or CAT-II), an enzyme of the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from carnitine to CoA in the mitochondrial matrix, thus regenerating free carnitine. b.

The latter may cause encephalopathy by hypoketonaemia, hypoglycaemia and hyperammonaemia. B. Increased acyl-CoA esters inhibit many enzymes and carriers. Long-chain acyl-CoA affects mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation at the adenine nucleotide carrier, and also inhibits other mitochondrial enzymes such as glutamate dehydrogenase, carnitine acetyltransferase and NAD(P) transhydrogenase.

This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. It", "to glucose 6phosphate Glucose 1-phosphate, produced by glycogen phosphorylase, is isomerized in the cytosol to glucose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase (see Fig. 11.6). In the liver, glucose 6-phosphate is transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by glucose 6-phosphate translocase. There, it is dephosphorylated to glucose by glucose 6-phosphatase (the same enzyme used in the last step of gluconeogenesis; see p. 121). The glucose is then transported from the ER to the cytosol. Hepatocytes release glycogen-derived glucose into the blood to help maintain blood glucose levels until the gluconeogenic pathway is actively producing glucose. [Note: Muscle lacks glucose 6-phosphatase. Consequently, glucose 6-phosphate cannot be dephosphorylated and sent into the blood. Instead, it enters glycolysis, providing energy needed for muscle contraction.] D. Lysosomal degradation A small amount (1%\u20133%) of glycogen is", "1-phosphate is converted to glucose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. In muscle, glucose 6phosphate enters glycolysis. In liver, the phosphate is removed by glucose 6-phosphatase (an enzyme of the endoplasmic reticular membrane), releasing free glucose that can be used to maintain blood glucose levels at the beginning of a fast. A deficiency of the phosphatase causes glycogen storage disease Ia (von Gierke disease) and results in an inability of the liver to provide free glucose to the body during a fast. It affects both glycogen degradation and gluconeogenesis. Glycogen synthesis and degradation are reciprocally regulated to meet whole-body needs by the same hormonal signals (namely, an elevated insulin level results in overall increased glycogenesis and decreased glycogenolysis, whereas an elevated glucagon, or epinephrine, level causes the opposite effects). Key enzymes", "subsequently dephosphorylating the 1-carbon. The result is glucose-6-phosphate, which can now theoretically travel down the glycolysis or pentose phosphate pathway. ## Function in Glycogenesis Phosphoglucomutase also acts in the opposite fashion when a large concentration of glucose-6-phosphate is present. In this case, it is the 1-carbon that is phosphorylated and the 6-carbon that is dephosphorylated. The resulting glucose-1-phosphate is then changed into UDP-glucose in a number of intermediate steps. If activated by insulin, glycogen synthase will proceed to clip the glucose from the UDP-glucose complex and on to the glycogen molecule. ## Disease Relevance Human muscle contains two phosphoglucomutases with nearly identical catalytic properties, PGM I and PGM II. One or the other of these forms is missing in some humans congenitally. Phosphoglucomutase deficiency is an extremely rare", "elongated by glycogen synthase. 2. Additional branch synthesis: After elongation of these two ends has been accomplished, their terminal six to eight glucosyl residues can be removed and used to make additional branches. IV. DEGRADATION (GLYCOGENOLYSIS) The degradative pathway that mobilizes stored glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle is not a reversal of the synthetic reactions. Instead, a separate set of cytosolic enzymes is required. When glycogen is degraded, the primary product is glucose 1-phosphate, obtained by breaking \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds. In addition, free glucose is released from each \u03b1(1\u21926)\u2013linked glucosyl residue (branch point). A. Chain shortening Glycogen phosphorylase sequentially cleaves the \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds between the glucosyl residues at the nonreducing ends of the glycogen chains by simple phosphorolysis (producing glucose 1-phosphate) until four glucosyl units remain", "concentrations of reactants and products will influence the actual change in free energy.) The hydrolysis reaction can be viewed as the transfer of the phosphate group to water. subunits in the large branched polysaccharide glycogen, which is present as small granules in the cytoplasm of many cells, including liver and muscle. The synthesis and degradation of glycogen are rapidly regulated according to need. When cells need more ATP than they can generate from the food molecules taken in from the bloodstream, they break down glycogen in a reaction that produces glucose 1-phosphate, which is rapidly converted to glucose 6-phosphate for glycolysis (Figure 2\u201352). Quantitatively, fat is far more important than glycogen as an energy store for animals, presumably because it provides for more efficient storage. The oxidation of", "needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. # Breakdown Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate that is then converted to Glucose 6-phosphate. A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the alpha(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates: - G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel. - G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars. - In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to Glucose by the enzyme Glucose 6-phosphatase. This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway.", "well as ribulose 5-phosphate, a carbon source for the synthesis of other molecules. Also, if the body needs nucleotide precursors of DNA for growth and synthesis, G6P will also be dehydrogenated and enter the pentose phosphate pathway. # Fate 2: Glycolysis If the cell needs energy or carbon skeletons for synthesis then glucose-6-phosphate is targeted for glycolysis. Glucose-6-phosphate is first isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase. This reaction converts glucose-6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in preparation for phosphorylation to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The addition of the 2nd phosphoryl group to produce Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an irreversible step, and so is used to irreversibly target the glucose-6-phosphate breakdown to provide energy for ATP production via glycolysis. # Fate 3: Storage as Glycogen If blood glucose levels are high, the body needs a way", "from point A to point B), insulin secretion increases. A failure to compensate by increasing the insulin secretion results initially in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; point C) and ultimately in type 2 DM (point D). NGT, normal glucose tolerance.

Glucose metabolism in insulin-independent tissues is not altered in type 2 DM. The precise molecular mechanism leading to insulin resistance in type 2 DM has not been elucidated.

This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme glycogen synthase which can exist in a glucose-6-phosphate-dependent, inactive form (D-form) and a glucose-6-phosphate-independent, active form (I-form).

Discussions of troponin often pertain to its functional characteristics and/or to its usefulness as a diagnostic marker for various heart disorders.

In resting muscle fibres, tropomyosin is displaced from its normal binding groove by troponin. This displaced conformation of tropomyosin prevents the binding of myosin heads, thereby inhibiting muscle contraction. Under normal stimulation to muscle fibers, Ca2+ ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the myocytes which causes troponin to release its hold on actin, allowing tropomyosin to return to a normal conformation which allows myosin heads to walk along actin filaments and thereby facilitating muscle contraction. # Functional Characteristics ## Sliding filament theory Tropomyosin is an alpha helical coiled coil protein dimer that binds end to end along F actin filaments in striated muscle.

Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding and hence crossbridge cycling in the absence of Ca2+ and the muscle Ca2+ regulatory element troponin. Ca2+ influx from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle myocytes binds to troponin and subsequently moves tropomyosin on the F-actin filament exposing the myosin binding sites. Recent structural visualization and kinetic modeling has suggested that myosin binding further moves tropomyosin on actin to a fully open state allowing for uninhibited crossbridge cycling as the muscle contracts.

INTRODUCTION: Bell's palsy is characterised by an acute, unilateral, partial, or complete paralysis of the face. Bell's palsy occurs in a lower motor neurone pattern. The weakness may be partial or complete, and may be associated with mild pain, numbness, increased sensitivity to sound, and altered taste. Bell's palsy is idiopathic, but a proportion of cases may be caused by re-activation of herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. Bell's palsy is most common in people aged 15 to 40 years, with a 1 in 60 lifetime risk. Most people make a spontaneous recovery within 1 month, but up to 30% show delayed or incomplete recovery. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review to answer the following clinical questions: What are the", "[Facial palsy]. Facial palsy is a daily challenge for the clinicians. Determining whether facial nerve palsy is peripheral or central is a key step in the diagnosis. Central nervous lesions can give facial palsy which may be easily differentiated from peripheral palsy. The next question is the peripheral facial paralysis idiopathic or symptomatic. A good knowledge of anatomy of facial nerve is helpful. A structure approach is given to identify additional features that distinguish symptomatic facial palsy from idiopathic one. The main cause of peripheral facial palsies is idiopathic one, or Bell's palsy, which remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The most common cause of symptomatic peripheral facial palsy is Ramsay-Hunt syndrome. Early identification of symptomatic facial palsy is important because of often worst outcome and different management. The", "there are a number of causes that may result in facial nerve paralysis. The most common is Bell's palsy, an idiopathicdisease that may only be diagnosed by exclusion. A thorough medical history and physical examination are the first steps in making a diagnosis. During the physical examination, a distinction must first be made between paralysis and paresis (incomplete paralysis). Not surprisingly, paralysis is far more serious and requires immediate treatment. It must also be determined whether the forehead is involved in the motor defect or not. This is usually accomplished by assessing how well a patient can raise her eyebrows. The question is an important one because it helps determine if the lesion is in the upper motor neuroncomponent of the facial nerve, or in its lower motor", "Acute Peripheral Facial Palsy: Recent Guidelines and a Systematic Review of the Literature.

The syndrome specifically refers to the combination of this entity with weakness of the muscles activated by the facial nerve.

Wrong blood in tube is a cause of ABO incompatible transfusion and there are various strategies available to try and expunge this event. METHODS: Survey of policy/practice before and after the introduction of a two-sample policy. RESULTS: Staff training is inadequate in reducing the risk of ABO incompatible transfusion. A two-sample policy was introduced and does not significantly increase workload or use of group O blood and does not compromise patient safety by causing delay in blood provision.

Many polypeptide chains are covalently modified during or after translation. Such modifications include amino acid removal; phosphorylation, which may activate or inactivate the protein; glycosylation, which plays a role in protein targeting; and hydroxylation such as that seen in collagen.

Finally, many proteins form complexes with other proteins or RNA molecules, and only function in the presence of these other molecules. # Methods of studying proteins ## Determining proteins which are post-translationally modified One way in which a particular protein can be studied is to develop an antibody which is specific to that modification. For example, there are antibodies which only recognize certain proteins when they are tyrosine-phosphorylated; also, there are antibodies specific to other modifications. These can be used to determine the set of proteins that have undergone the modification of interest. For sugar modifications, such as glycosylation of proteins, certain lectins have been discovered which bind sugars. These too can be used.

For decades, lactate was considered the cause of fatigue in exercising muscles based on experiments conducted in the 1920s on non-oxygenated frog muscles. The lactate shuttle hypothesis was described over 30 years ago by Brooks, who suggested that lactate is a substrate exchanged between glycolytic and oxidative tissues/cells, allowing for the control of its cytosolic concentration. During the past 20 years, researchers in the muscle and exercise physiology fields have worked to understand the real effects of lactate and H+ during muscle activity. It has now been established that lactate is not cause of fatigue.

To this end, it has been suggested that contractile activity in muscle fibers could cause a pumping action that would favor more rapid exchange of fluid between the t-system lumen and the interstitium. Such pumping action would also explain the relevance of lactate and glucose transporters in the t-system (;, despite the fact that diffusion of these molecules along the t-system is probably slow.", "LDH works to prevent muscular failure and fatigue in multiple ways. The lactate-forming reaction generates cytosolic NAD+, which feeds into the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction to help maintain cytosolic redox potential and promote substrate flux through the second phase of glycolysis to promote ATP generation. This, in effect, provides more energy to contracting muscles under heavy workloads. The production and removal of lactate from the cell also ejects a proton consumed in the LDH reaction- the removal of excess protons produced in the wake of this fermentation reaction serves to act as a buffer system for muscle acidosis. Once proton accumulation exceeds the rate of uptake in lactate production and removal through the LDH symport, muscular acidosis occurs. # Medical relevance LDH is a protein that normally appears", "Kinetic analysis and design of experiments to identify the catalytic mechanism of the monocarboxylate transporter isoforms 4 and 1. Transport of lactate, pyruvate, and other monocarboxylates across the sarcolemma of skeletal and cardiac myocytes occurs via passive diffusion and by monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) mediated transport. The flux of lactate and protons through the MCT plays an important role in muscle energy metabolism during rest and exercise and in pH regulation during exercise. The MCT isoforms 1 and 4 are the major isoforms of this transporter in skeletal and cardiac muscle.

The acidosis that is associated with increases in lactate concentration during heavy exercise arises from a separate reaction. When ATP is hydrolysed, a hydrogen ion is released. ATP-derived hydrogen ions are primarily responsible for the decrease in pH. During intense exercise, aerobic metabolism cannot produce ATP quickly enough to supply the demands of the muscle.

There is only limited research on monitoring respiratory rate, and these studies have focused on such issues as the inaccuracy of respiratory rate measurement and respiratory rate as a marker for respiratory dysfunction. # Measurement The human respiration rate is usually measured when a person is at rest and simply involves counting the number of breaths for one minute by counting how many times the chest rises. Respiration rates may increase with fever, illness, and with other medical conditions. When checking respiration, it is important to also note whether a person has any difficulty breathing. Inaccuracies in respiratory measurement have been reported in", "ventilation with room air (Fig. 32-3). his should be started by 60 seconds of life, if not sooner, once the initial steps are completed. Assisted ventilation by facemask at a rate of 40 to 60 breaths per minute is recommended. Oxygen saturation is monitored by pulse oximetry. Supplemental oxygen can be given in graduated, rising percentages to maintain oxygen saturation values within a normal range per minute of life. Adequate ventilation is best indicated by an improved heart rate. Colorimetric end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETC02) monitoring placed between the positive-pressure device and facemask serves as a helpful adjunct for detection of successful gas exchange during mask ventilation (Weiner, 2016).

Another simple procedure for quantitating purely vagal function consists of measuring the variation in heart rate during deep breathing (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The ECG is recorded while the patient breathes at a regular rate of 6 breaths per minute. Normally, the heart rate varies by as many as 10 beats per minute or even more between expiration and inspiration; differences of less than 7 beats per minute for ages 60 to 69 and 9 for ages", "and thus ventilation increases during exercise (sometimes by more than twentyfold) and during metabolic acidosis as a compensatory response. Naturally, the work rate required to overcome the elasticity of the respiratory system increases with both the depth and the frequency of tidal breaths, while the work required to overcome the dynamic load increases with total ventilation. A modest increase of ventilation is most efficiently achieved by increasing tidal volume but not respiratory rate, which is the normal ventilatory response to lower-level exercise. At high levels of exercise, deep breathing persists, but respiratory rate also increases. The pattern chosen by the respiratory controller minimizes the work of breathing. The work of breathing also increases when disease reduces the compliance of the respiratory system or increases the resistance to airflow."]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_clinicalknowledge", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

Surgical incisions are typically made along cleavage lines; the cut tends to parallel the collagen fibers, thus minimizing the need for excess collagen production and the inherent scarring that may occur.

The clinical signs suggesting Cushing's disease, such as obesity, moon face, hirsutism, and facial plethora are already present on presentation.

Insulin is responsible for the intracellular transport of amino acids as well, essential for protein synthesis and muscle recovery. Contrary to insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol, and GH are known as glucose-raising hormones. IGF molecules can be seen as specifically positioned in this network, as they are mediators of the anabolic function of GH and yet, they exert insulin-like activity.", "Passing on the exercise baton: What can endocrine patients learn from elite athletes?. An athletes' ability to push the boundaries of modern sporting performance limits is dependent on their ability to optimize physiological adaptations from rigorous, chronic progressive training.

The provision of different fuels for exercise (i.e., phosphocreatine, carbohydrate, and lipids) are fine\u2010tuned by the interactions of several endocrine hormones viz, insulin, glucagon, catecholamines, growth hormone (GH), and cortisol.Volitional muscle contraction initiates parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathoadrenal activity which releases adrenaline and noradrenaline from the adrenal medulla, inhibiting pancreatic insulin secretion to below basal levels.Concurrently, catecholamines and glucagon (and later GH and cortisol) increase hepatic glucose output via glycogenolysis", "The Role of Skeletal Muscle Glycogen Breakdown for Regulation of Insulin Sensitivity by Exercise. The physiological role of adrenaline-stimulated glycogen breakdown in non-active muscles is debated.

During a 2-day fast, glycogen stores are depleted, and gluconeogenesis maintains blood glucose. This is an energy-requiring (endergonic) pathway (both ATP and GTP get hydrolyzed) that occurs primarily in the liver, with the kidneys becoming major glucose producers in prolonged fasting.

Fatty acid degradation yields acetyl", "Exercise and deficient carbohydrate storage and intake as causes of hypoglycemia. Exercise is associated with a marked increase in glucose uptake by muscle, which is initially supported by breakdown of hepatic glycogen and subsequently by increased gluconeogenesis. If hepatic glucose production is inadequate, hypoglycemia results. During exercise there is decreased plasma insulin and increased catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone, which contribute to but are not essential for the increased hepatic output of glucose. Although insulin concentrations fall, insulin sensitivity is increased. However, the augmented glucose uptake by muscle is due to other factors. The symptoms of exhaustion during exercise are not due to hypoglycemia, and prevention of hypoglycemia may not prolong the time of exercise to exhaustion.

Immediately after physical activity, muscle cells that sustained a substantial decrease in glycogen content are metabolically prepared for rapid glycogenesis. In brief, glycogen use during exercise turns on glycogen synthesis during recovery.

Both the intensity and duration of exercise may be of importance in initiating or maintaining the hormonal response. Impulses from either the working muscles or motor centers, via the central nervous system, modify the response of the glands of the endocrine system directly via pituitary hormones or indirectly via the sympathoadrenal system. The initial response to the onset of exercise is enhancement of sympathoadrenal activity and secretion of pituitary hormones, which result in a reduction in the plasma concentration of insulin and a rise in that of virtually all other hormones. Because of this shift in hormone balance, a modification of the metabolism of intra- and extra-muscular triglycerides and glycogen as fuels for muscular exercise occurs. The variation in mobilization of one fuel source may well influence", "the cytosol. The increased calcium availability binds to the calmodulin subunit and activates glycogen phosphorylase kinase. Glycogen phosphorylase kinase activates glycogen phosphorylase in the same manner mentioned previously. Glycogen phosphorylase b is not always inactive in muscle, as it can be activated allosterically by AMP. An increase in AMP concentration, which occurs during strenuous exercise, signals energy demand. AMP activates glycogen phosphorylase b by changing its conformation from a tense to a relaxed form. This relaxed form has similar enzymatic properties as the phosphorylated enzyme. An increase in ATP concentration opposes this activation by displacing AMP from the nucleotide binding site, indicating sufficient energy stores. Upon eating a meal, there is a release of insulin, signaling glucose availability in the blood. Insulin indirectly activates PP-1 and phosphodiesterase.

The following conclusions can be drawn from the presented information. First, type 2 diabetes is characterized by reduced membrane flexibility in the pancreatic \u03b2-cell, which adversely affects the amount of glucose entering the \u03b2-cell via GLUT2, and thereby lowers the synthesis of the necessary amount of circulating insulin molecules. Secondly, fusion of the insulin-containing granule with the \u03b2-cell plasma membrane, followed by the formation of a suitable pore diameter for insulin transport into the blood circulation, requires high flexibility in both the granule-cell membrane and the \u03b2-cell membrane.

However, the pressure to remove mercury-containing medical devices is leading to the demise of the mercury sphygmomanometer and the loss of manual blood pressure measurement skills. The article argues that there is still a place for the mercury sphygmomanometer, particularly when a clinical decision is based on the blood pressure readings. It presents a review of the available literature to explain the rationale for the use of manual sphygmomanometry and gives a step-by-step guide to the procedure with current supporting evidence. There is a brief discussion of special considerations when dealing with certain client groups. Normal blood pressure ranges for adults and children have been", "has been higher. ## Blood Pressure The blood pressure is recorded as two readings, a high systolic pressure which is the maximal contraction of the heart and the lower diastolic or resting pressure. Usually the blood pressure is taken in the right arm unless there is some damage to the arm. The difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure is called the pulse pressure. The measurement of these pressures is now usually done with an aneroid or electronic sphygmomanometer. The classic measurement device is a mercury sphygmomanometer, using a column of mercury measured off in millimeters. In the United States and UK, the common form is millimeters of mercury, whilst elsewhere SI units of pressure are used.

Data from 7 studiesin 4 countries (Table 1) showed that the mean office BP in routine clinical practice of 153/90 mmHg corresponded to a mean office BP of 143/83 mmHg recorded in a research study. Although the threshold for defining hypertension based upon office BP has traditionally been 140/90 mmHg, a threshold of 150/97 mmHg might be more appropriate. Until recently, little attention has been given to this discrepancy, but it is now timely to consider alternatives to manual office BP measurement.", "Utilizing a blood pressure cuff that is too small may lead to a significant overestimation of blood pressure. Fonseca-Reyes et al. (2003) found that when a cuff is too small, for every 5 cm increase in arm circumference, there was a 2-5 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and a 1-3 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, use of a cuff that is too large leads to an underestimation of blood pressure. Regular calibration of aneroid and electronic blood pressure monitors is required in order to ensure that blood pressure measurements begin from a starting point of zero.

The change in the ratio showed two significances: (a) gave the victim more chest compressions per minute (28% or more) and (b) same compression-ventilation ratio applied regardless of the number of rescuers. If one rescue breathing is performed per five compressions, the interruptions between the compressions occur too frequently during CPR, resulting in decreased coronary artery perfusion.

Every single 'beat' of the heart involves three major stages that together form one cardiac cycle: 1- Atrial systole 2- Ventricular systole 3- Complete cardiac diastole While the term systole is synonymous with contraction (movement or stretching) of a muscle, the term diastole is synonymous with relaxation of a muscle. # Atrial Systole - Atrial systole is the contraction of the heart muscle (myocardia) of the left and right atria.

Ventricular diastole is when the ventricles are relaxing, while atrial diastole is when the atria are relaxing. # Inside the heart During ventricular diastole, the pressure in the (left and right) ventricles drops from the peak that it reaches in systole. When the pressure in the left ventricle drops to below the pressure in the left atrium, the mitral valve (bicuspid valve) opens, causing accumulated blood from the atrium to flow into the ventricle. # Inside the arteries The adjective \"diastolic\" is used to refer to the relaxation of the heart between muscle contractions.

It is interesting to ponder upon the question as to how much this symmetry of systole and diastole principal can cover. The systole includes isovolumic contraction and ejection phases. However, there are four phases in diastole: isovolumic relaxation, rapid inflow, diastasis and atrial systole. From the above analysis, we come to a conclusion that there could be symmetric Tau and dp/dt, which reveals the symmetry exists between isovolumic contraction and isovolumic relaxation. It deserves to mention that during isovolumic periods, both the aortic and mitral valve are closed, which makes it the best time to evaluate cardiac function due to relative independence of foreload and afterload.

These events are necessary for any success of emergency cardiovascular care. They are linked in a chain of survival.

Inflammation, irritation, or degeneration of anatomically related structures such as the eyes, neck, and sinuses can equally cause headaches. In addition, patients with rheumatologic disorders have the same tendencies as the general population to develop primary headaches. While the latter are benign in nature, and generally require only symptomatic relief, the former type of headaches may signal disease manifestation, progression, or complication. Thus, familiarity with common and uncommon headache syndromes related to rheumatologic disorders as well as with their possible underlying disease processes and mechanisms is important.

Often there is striking accentuation of pain with eye movement. Meningitis can be easily mistaken for migraine in that the cardinal symptoms of pounding headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting are frequently present, perhaps reflecting the underlying biology of some of the patients.

Nevertheless, a few aspects of the examination are worth emphasizing. For example, auscultation of the skull may rarely disclose a bruit (with large arteriovenous malformations); palpation may disclose the tender, hardened or elevated arteries of temporal arteritis; sensitive areas overlying a cranial metastasis or an inflamed paranasal sinus may be apparent; or there may be a tender occipital nerve.

Simultaneously, it also causes the wall of the large elastic arteries to distend.

(The pressures stated are resting values and stated as relative to surrounding atmospheric which is the typical \"0\" reference pressure used in medicine.) # Function For excellence of health, the left ventricular muscle must: - (a) relax very rapidly after each contraction so as to fill rapidly with oxygenated blood flowing from the lung veins, i.e. diastolic relaxation and filling. - (b) contract rapidly", "Echocardiographic RV-E/e\u2032 for predicting right atrial pressure: a review. During normal sinus rhythm, right ventricular (RV) diastolic filling is a biphasic process. In early diastole, elastic recoil of myocardial fibres results in early rapid relaxation of the RV, leading to a sharp fall in pressure and early passive filling of the ventricle through a suction effect. In late diastole, filling occurs through the atrial contraction. The maximum pressure difference between the two chambers can be calculated via the Bernoulli equation from the peak blood velocity of the forward flow on continuous-wave Doppler, however, this does not provide us with an estimate of the absolute pressure in either chamber.

The ventricles must maximize systolic pressure to force blood through the circulation, so all the ventricular cells must work together. Ventricular contraction begins at the apex of the heart, progressing upwards to eject blood into the great arteries.

The maximal amount of anaerobic energy that can be utilized is proportional to the sum of the maximum amount of Cr and", "within muscles. The oxidative system (aerobic) is the primary source of ATP supplied to the body at rest and during low intensity activities and uses primarily carbohydrates and fats as substrates. Protein is not normally metabolized significantly, except during long term starvation and long bouts of exercise (greater than 90 minutes.) At rest approximately 70% of the ATP produced is derived from fats and 30% from carbohydrates. Following the onset of activity, as the intensity of the exercise increases, there is a shift in substrate preference from fats to carbohydrates. During high intensity aerobic exercise, almost 100% of the energy is derived from carbohydrates, if an adequate supply is available. # Exercise physiology There are several companies testing the public for the respiratory quotient that identifies heart rates", "rate. The efficiency of by-product removal by muscles can improve through training. # Anaerobic biochemistry Anaerobics are activities that are carried out 'without oxygen'. This terminology refers to the molecular level of respiration, not the respiration of the organism as a whole (i.e., breathing). During anaerobic exercise, the muscles being exercised have insufficient oxygen to meet the demands of the activity, and thus must also use alternate, non-oxygen-dependent processes to produce energy. The muscle does still receive oxygen during anaerobic exercise; the average drop in blood oxygen content throughout the body is likely minimal. Anaerobic exercise begins with muscles utilizing stored creatine phosphate to generate the ATP that produces muscle contraction. After several seconds, further ATP energy is made available to muscles by metabolizing muscle glycogen into pyruvate", "includes 22 +/- 8 max acceleration efforts. Human physiology relies on the energy stored in one of the phosphate bonds in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to power all activities. Breaking this bond changes ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) which must then be converted back to ATP by one of the three main energy systems: phosphocreatine (ATP-Pcr), glycolytic, and aerobic. The cardiopulmonary system plays a key role in supplying the required energy resources and shuttling off by-products such as carbon dioxide, lactate and H+ ions. The following section briefly outlines some of the key considerations for the various energy systems.", "Energy systems efficiency influences the results of 2,000 m race simulation among elite rowers. The fastest energy source identified in the study group, during exercise was represented by adenosine triphosphate hydrolization (ATP), an action also reported in other papers []. However due to low concentration found in the body, different mechanisms are used to maintain muscle contraction]. The first phase of the energy system is considered to be the phosphates, phosphocreatine and ATP use in order to sustain energy distribution during the beginning of the effort, which is characterized through high intensity activity, and oxygen debt [], related in our study to a RER above 1.0, and an elevated carbohydrate consumption.

The various mechanisms responsible for ATP resynthesis include phosphocreatine (PCr) hydrolysis, anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Among these, the latter represents the most important mechanism of energy provision. However, oxidative phosphorylation is characterized by a lower maximal power and a slow attainment of a steady state in response to increased metabolic demand. The rate of adjustment of oxidative metabolism during metabolic transitions, which can be evaluated on the basis of the analysis of O2 uptake (VO2) kinetics, has implications for exercise tolerance and muscle fatigue. Analysis of VO2 kinetics represents a valid tool for the functional evaluation of healthy subjects, athletes and patients.

Within the voluntary skeletal muscles, the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules in the process (note that in aerobic conditions, lactate is not formed; instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle). Muscle cells also contain globules of fat, which are used for energy during aerobic exercise. The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP and reach peak efficiency, and requires many more biochemical steps, but produces significantly more ATP than anaerobic glycolysis. Cardiac muscle on the other hand, can readily consume any of the three macronutrients (protein, glucose and fat) aerobically without a 'warm up' period and always", "most representative can be presented in a textbook of neurology. The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "by muscle decline rapidly, and these changes have important health and functional consequences. Balance Between Energy Availability and Energy demand Release of phosphate from ATP provides every living cell with the energy required for life. However, the storage of ATP is only enough for 6 sec; therefore, ATP is constantly resynthesized. Although ATP can be resynthesized by anaerobic glycolysis, most of the energy used in the body is generated through aerobic metabolism. Therefore, energy consumption is usually estimated indirectly by oxygen consumption (indirect calorimetry). There is currently no method to measure true \u201cfitness,\u201d which is the maximal energy that can be produced by an organism over extended periods. Thus, fitness is estimated indirectly from peak oxygen consumption (MVo ), often during a maximal treadmill test. gressively with aging", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt. The greater the reliance on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy requirements of muscle contraction, the greater the oxygen debt. Gordon AM, Homsher E, Regnier M.

This is because lactate itself is not capable of releasing a proton, and secondly, the acidic form of lactate, lactic acid, cannot be formed under normal circumstances in human tissues.

Indeed, Kopennol et al. suggest that the increased lactate production in tumor cells arises from damage to the regulation of glycolysis and not to insufficient respiration. However, the competing argument is inconsistent with the observation that the lactate made by muscle cells during intense exercise falls significantly after oxygen is restored to the muscle tissue. This would indicate that the lactate was made primarily because O2 was unavailable for robust OxPhos. In addition, oxygen deprivation or hypoxia causes all known cultured mammalian cells to increase lactate production. An increase in lactate is also seen in adequately oxygenated cells when respiration is inhibited either by respiratory", "step 6 begins the energy-generation phase of glycolysis.

Within the voluntary skeletal muscles, the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules in the process (note that in aerobic conditions, lactate is not formed; instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle). Muscle cells also contain globules of fat, which are used for energy during aerobic exercise. The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP and reach peak efficiency, and requires many more biochemical steps, but produces significantly more ATP than anaerobic glycolysis.

However, it can take 2-4 min, or even longer at higher work rates, before this steady state is attained. Slow VO(2) kinetics increase the so-called O(2) deficit and obligate a greater contribution from anaerobic mechanisms of ATP production (involving the breakdown of muscle high energy phosphates and lactate production from glycogen) to meet the ATP requirement of the exercise task.

Not only is experimental support lacking for the notion that glycolytic flux is directed to lactate production only when oxygen is lacking, there is no evidence that the first step in lactate oxidation (i.e., conversion to pyruvate) occurs in the cytosol of any tissue, including the beating heart or working skeletal muscle that has a lactate to pyruvate concentration ratio (L/P) > 100 [], and which are net glucose consumers []."]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_clinicalknowledge", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

The net results of these actions are most apparent in the fasting state, when the supply of glucose from gluconeogenesis, the release of amino acids from muscle catabolism, the inhibition of peripheral glucose uptake, and the stimulation of lipolysis all contribute to maintenance of an adequate glucose supply to the brain.

Glucagon and epinephrine: Secretion of these counterregulatory hormones is most important in the acute, short-term regulation of blood glucose levels. Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Epinephrine promotes glycogenolysis and lipolysis. It inhibits insulin secretion, thereby preventing GLUT-4\u2013mediated uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissues. Epinephrine assumes a critical role in hypoglycemia when glucagon secretion is deficient, for example, in the late stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus (see p. 340).

In the absence of food, plasma levels of glucose, amino acids, and TAG fall, triggering a decline in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol secretion. The decreased insulin/counterregulatory hormone ratio and the decreased availability of circulating substrates make the postabsorptive period of nutrient deprivation a catabolic period characterized by degradation of TAG, glycogen, and protein.

As a result, the brain continues to derive almost all its energy from oxidation of glucose. Synthesis of this glucose in liver is the biggest consumer of amino acids made available by net degradation of muscle protein.

Enhancing the expression of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis is probably the best-known metabolic function of glucocorticoids. - Mobilization of amino acids from extrahepatic tissues: These serve as substrates for gluconeogenesis. - Inhibition of glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue: A mechanism to conserve glucose. - Stimulation of fat breakdown in adipose", "blood cells require a source of amino acids and other nutrients. Synthesis of acute-phase proteins required for host defense also needs amino acids. In addition, the wound, regenerating tissue, and white blood cells require large amounts of glucose for glycolysis. That the wound is poorly vascularized may be the major reason for hyperglycemia, which provides a glucose gradient between plasma and tissue high enough for extraction of sufficient glucose. The wound does not increase net consumption of glucose; rather, lactate returns to the liver to be converted again to glucose.

Surgeons, generally, are even more conservative with ileal pouches. Across the board, a high proportion of surgeons apply a mandatory policy of TDI.

Then the kinetics of PCr recovery defines the kinetics of oxygen supply and substrate utilization. The second principle is the constancy of PCr and H(+) (lactate) production by glycogenolysis due to the coupling of ATPase and glycolysis. This principle enables glycogenolytic flux to be measured from intracellular proton loads.

Anaerobic glycolysis produces lactate, ATP, and water but there is no net change in the number of hydrogen ions: it does not produce lactic acid. The acidosis usually associated with hyperlactataemia is caused by hydrolysis of the ATP, with release of hydrogen ions. By contrast, ATP turnover by aerobic mechanisms is not acidifying because the released hydrogen ion is reutilised as more ATP is formed. Gluconeogenesis from lactate does not utilise hydrogen ions directly--in fact, it produces them.

Contrary to popular belief, this increased concentration of lactate does not directly cause acidosis, nor is it responsible for delayed onset muscle soreness. This is because lactate itself is not capable of releasing a proton, and secondly, the acidic form of lactate, lactic acid, cannot be formed under normal circumstances in human tissues. Analysis of the glycolytic pathway in humans indicates that there are not enough hydrogen ions present in the glycolytic intermediates to produce lactic or any other acid.

Released energy (originally from the sun and photosynthesis) is stored as ATP, to be later used for energy requiring metabolism. The fuel's carbon is oxidized to CO2, which diffuses down its partial pressure gradient out of the cells into venous blood to finally be exhaled by the lungs. Experimentally, oxygen diffusion becomes rate limiting (and lethal) when arterial oxygen partial pressure falls to 40mmHg or below. If oxygen delivery to cells is insufficient for the demand (hypoxia), hydrogen will be shifted to pyruvic acid converting it to lactic acid.

Lactate diffuses out of the cell and into the blood.The lactate in the bloodstream is converted back into pyruvate in the liver, for use when oxygen is once again present. Certain cells, such as cardiac muscle cells, are highly permeable to lactate. Lactate is converted into pyruvate and metabolised normally (ie: via the citric acid cycle). Since these cells are highly oxygenated, it is unlikely that lactate would accumulate (as is the case in oxygen-starved muscle cells).

Glycogenolysis may only be protective until the accumulation of metabolites (lactate, H+, NADH, sugar phosphates and Pi ) outweighs the benefit of the ATP produced. The possible deleterious effects associated with increased glycolysis cannot be ignored, and may explain some of the controversial findings reported in the literature. However, an optimal balance between the rate of ATP production and rate of accumulation of metabolites (determined by the glycolytic flux rate and the rate of coronary washout), may ensure optimal recovery.

It stimulates glycogen breakdown into glucose even when insulin levels are abnormally high. # In muscle and other cells Muscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle", "The role of skeletal muscle glycogen breakdown for regulation of insulin sensitivity by exercise. Glycogen is the storage form of carbohydrates in mammals. In humans the majority of glycogen is stored in skeletal muscles (\u223c500 g) and the liver (\u223c100 g). Food is supplied in larger meals, but the blood glucose concentration has to be kept within narrow limits to survive and stay healthy. Therefore, the body has to cope with periods of excess carbohydrates and periods without supplementation. Healthy persons remove blood glucose rapidly when glucose is in excess, but insulin-stimulated glucose disposal is reduced in insulin resistant and type 2 diabetic subjects. During a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, 70-90% of glucose disposal will be stored as muscle glycogen in healthy subjects. The glycogen stores in skeletal muscles", "8.9 mmol/L during recovery from short term, high intensity exercise. This is markedly higher than the blood glucose values of 2 to 3.4 mmol/L after prolonged exercise. In response to this elevation in plasma glucose levels, insulin levels increase to approximately 60 microU/ml, a 2-fold increase over resting values. Both glucose and insulin regulate glycogen synthase activity, and higher levels of them improve muscle glycogen synthesis. Secondly, high intensity exercise produces high levels of glycolytic intermediates in muscle, as well as high lactate levels ([La]) in muscle and blood. Finally, fast-twitch glycolytic muscle fibres are more heavily used in short term, high intensity exercise. This promotes greater glycogen depletion in the fast-twitch fibres, which have a higher level of glycogen synthase activity than slow-twitch fibres. While the exact", "for ATP that accompanies contraction. At rest, muscle accounts for ~25% of the oxygen (O2) consumption of the body, whereas during vigorous exercise, it is responsible for up to 90%. This underscores the fact that skeletal muscle, despite its potential for transient periods of anaerobic glycolysis, is an oxidative tissue. A. Carbohydrate metabolism 1. Increased glucose transport: The transient increase in plasma glucose and insulin after a carbohydrate-rich meal leads to an increase in glucose transport into muscle cells (myocytes) by GLUT-4 (see p. 97 and Fig. 24.7, ), thereby reducing blood glucose. Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase and metabolized to meet the energy needs of myocytes. 2. Increased glycogenesis: The increased insulin/glucagon ratio and the availability of glucose 6-phosphate favor glycogen synthesis, particularly if", "The Role of Skeletal Muscle Glycogen Breakdown for Regulation of Insulin Sensitivity by Exercise. Exercise physiologists have performed numerous studies on glycogen utilization during exercise and studied the effects of nutritional supply for optimal glycogen repletion after exercise (Ivy,; Betts and Williams,. Rapid glycogen repletion requires that high rates of blood glucose must be taken up by skeletal muscles, and insulin sensitivity is high after exercise. Diabetes is defined by elevated blood glucose and a major defect is that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis is impaired in skeletal muscle (Shulman et al.,. A common point at issue for both diabetologists and exercise physiologists is: How can blood glucose rapidly be converted into skeletal muscle glycogen? In the present review we have taken the view of exercise physiologists", "glycogen degradation, and gluconeogenesis. Dietary intake of glucose and glucose precursors, such as starch (a polysaccharide), disaccharides, and monosaccharides, is sporadic and, depending on the diet, is not always a reliable source of blood glucose. In contrast, gluconeogenesis (see p. 117) can provide sustained synthesis of glucose, but it is somewhat slow in responding to a falling blood glucose level. Therefore, the body has developed mechanisms for storing a supply of glucose in a rapidly mobilized form, namely, glycogen. In the absence of a dietary source of glucose, this sugar is rapidly released into the blood from liver glycogen. Similarly, muscle glycogen is extensively degraded in exercising muscle to provide that tissue with an important energy source. When glycogen stores are depleted, specific tissues synthesize glucose de novo,", "1997 Sir William Refshauge Lecture. Skeletal muscle glucose metabolism during exercise: implications for health and performance. Skeletal muscle glucose uptake and metabolism are major determinants of whole body glucose metabolism in response to exercise and insulin stimulation. An understanding of the mechanisms responsible for increased muscle glucose uptake under these conditions is crucial for identifying strategies that enhance insulin action and exercise performance. Regular exercise, by favourably influencing the intramuscular determinants of glucose uptake, enhances insulin action. For this reason, it is recommended in the prevention and management of disease states that are characterised by insulin resistance (\"metabolic syndrome\"). Increased skeletal muscle glucose uptake, as a consequence of carbohydrate ingestion, maintains carbohydrate supply to contracting muscle, at a time when glycogen levels are reduced, and is associated with", "Fundamentals of glycogen metabolism for coaches and athletes. Immediately after physical activity, muscle cells that sustained a substantial decrease in glycogen content are metabolically prepared for rapid glycogenesis. In brief, glycogen use during exercise turns on glycogen synthesis during recovery. When carbohydrates are ingested soon after exercise, insulin release from the pancreas, insulin sensitivity in muscle cells, glucose uptake by muscle cells, and glycogen synthase activity within muscle cells all increase, responses that can remain elevated for 48 hours., Repeated intake of 1.0\u20131.2 g carbohydrate/kg BW/hour after exercise takes advantage of these metabolic circumstances to stimulate high rates of glycogen synthesis (10\u201311 mmol/kg wet weight/h)., When 24 hours of rest occur between exercise sessions, ingesting a total of 10 g/kg BW, along with enough energy (calories) to maintain", "to glucose, and an increase in the muscle's sensitivity to insulin. The slow phase of glycogen synthesis appears to be under the control of an intermediate form of glycogen synthase that is highly sensitive to glucose-6-phosphate activation. Conversion of the enzyme to this intermediate form may be due to the muscle tissue being constantly exposed to an elevated plasma insulin concentration subsequent to several days of high carbohydrate consumption. For optimal training performance, muscle glycogen stores must be replenished on a daily basis. For the average endurance athlete, a daily carbohydrate consumption of 500 to 600g is required. This results in a maximum glycogen storage of 80 to 100 mumol/g wet weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_clinicalknowledge", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

However, they needed to review these recommendations to ensure that they were in line with the changes to the recommendations on admission, management and discharge, and to avoid any contradictions. For most babies and children, the oxygen saturation threshold has been lowered to 90% for admission, management and discharge, but the committee felt that the original threshold of 92% remained appropriate for referral.

The trial also showed that readmission rates were not higher with a 90% threshold, compared with a 94% threshold. The intervention, population and setting of the trial were directly relevant to management and discharge from hospital, so the committee believed it was appropriate to change the oxygen saturation thresholds used in the 2015 guideline. In addition, they noted that the 2015 thresholds were based on the 2015 committee's experience alone, because no direct evidence was available at the time.

As a result, the committee removed the oxygen saturation threshold as a criterion that requires immediate referral to hospital and instead included it as a criterion that requires consideration of referral to hospital.

Possible interactions of additional factors such as disturbances in electrolyte concentrations (i.e. magnesium ions) were also not precisely defined. One of the best-suited tools for this kind of problem is systems biology, which enables modeling of metabolic pathways. In", "Exercise, oxidants, and antioxidants change the shape of the bell-shaped hormesis curve. It is quite clear that the adaptive response to exercise depends on the intensity of the exercise, and the eventual ROS production, which is intensity dependent (Fig. 1). Exercise with very high intensity using ATP, CrP as the main energy sources, where fatigue is due to the accumulation of Pi, AMP, H+, ammonia and other metabolic products, is not normal practice. Recovery is very fast after anaerobic alactic dominant fatigue. When ATP is regenerated from mainly glycolytic pathways decreased pH and Na-K pump excitability levels could lead to fatigue, among other factors, but recovery within an hour. When aerobic exercise is used, one of the reasons for fatigue is the depletion of muscle glycogen. The recovery", "conclusions that (a) hypersomolarity is unlikely to be in an important factor initiating or maintaining functional hyperaemia in skeletal muscle, (b) while K+ release may contribute in fast muscle it can hardly be the factor initiating the response, and (c) inorganic phosphate is the only substance tested so far whose efflux is consistently related to the vascular response in all muscles under a variety of experimental conditions, and whose efficacy as a vasodilator seems adequate.", "intracellular pH is also a likely player in reducing Vmax during muscle fatigue. The myosin ATPase activity is lowered at low pH, perhaps because of lower rates of release of ADP from the myosin head, which has been found to reduce Vmax (;;. It has been noticed that in the initial phase of muscle fatigue, small decreases in Fmax could occur in the absence of appreciable change in Vmax (;. Because phosphocreatine is the energy reserve (\u223c20 mM) in muscle cells used first to replenish ATP in a process that produces inorganic phosphate, short-term fatigue is likely mainly caused by an increase in intracellular [Pi]. As mentioned above, high [Pi] is able to reduce Fmax without affecting Vmax, making it a likely candidate for causing the initial decrease", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt. The greater the reliance on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy requirements of muscle contraction, the greater the oxygen debt. Gordon AM, Homsher E, Regnier M.

The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

The oxidative system (aerobic) is the primary source of ATP supplied to the body at rest and during low intensity activities and uses primarily carbohydrates and fats as substrates. Protein is not normally metabolized significantly, except during long term starvation and long bouts of exercise (greater than 90 minutes.) At rest approximately 70% of the ATP produced is derived from fats and 30% from carbohydrates. Following the onset of activity, as the intensity of the exercise increases, there is a shift in substrate preference from fats to carbohydrates. During high intensity aerobic exercise, almost 100% of the energy is derived from carbohydrates, if an adequate supply is available. # Exercise physiology There are several companies testing the public for the respiratory quotient that identifies heart rates", "regenerate an intermediate.

An adult man weighing 65 kg and exercising moderate activity would recycle an estimated 70 kg of ATP every day. On the other hand, the overall amount of ATP present in his body at any time would probably not exceed 100 g, an energy reserve equivalent to approximately two minutes (a few seconds for the brain).

In view of the reliance of all cells on the availability of ATP to maintain viability, fatigue has been described as a protective mechanism to minimize the risk of muscle cell injury or death. Consequently, it is likely that skeletal muscle cells have developed redundant systems to ensure that ATP levels do not drop to dangerously low levels and hence risk the viability of the cell. Most persons tire and cease exercise long before the motor unit fatigues. General physical fatigue may be defined as a homeostatic disturbance produced by work. The basis for the perceived discomfort (or even pain) probably involves many factors.

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "can be established which determines how much fuel is utilized in which packets for work accomplished by the muscles. Protein catabolism (breakdown) has been estimated to supply 10% to 15% of the total energy requirement during a two hour training session. However, if a person's muscle glycogen supplies are low from previous exercise sessions, the amount of energy derived from protein catabolism could increase from 15% to 45%. This process could severely degrade the protein structures needed to maintain survival such as contractile properties of proteins in the heart, cellular mitochondria, myoglobin storage, and metabolic enzymes within muscles. The oxidative system (aerobic) is the primary source of ATP supplied to the body at rest and during low intensity activities and uses primarily carbohydrates and fats as substrates. Protein", "During short lasting near maximal exercise (0-30 s), the anaerobic utilization of muscle PCr and glycogen will fuel muscle contraction. Evidence is available to indicate that fatigue during this type of exercise is related to the inability of type II fibres to maintain the required very high rate of ATP resynthesis. This has been suggested to result from a rapid depletion of type II fibre PCr stores and an insufficiency of the glycogenolytic rate to compensate for the fall in ATP production when the PCr store is depleted.

During a 2-day fast, glycogen stores are depleted, and gluconeogenesis maintains blood glucose. This is an energy-requiring (endergonic) pathway (both ATP and GTP get hydrolyzed) that occurs primarily in the liver, with the kidneys becoming major glucose producers in prolonged fasting.

Therefore, 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio. # Non-mammal Y chromosome Many groups of organisms in addition to mammals have Y chromosomes, but these Y chromosomes do not share common ancestry with mammalian Y", "Gender selection: pressure from patients and industry should not alter our adherence to ethical guidelines. Patients who undergo assisted reproduction occasionally request that physicians intervene with techniques that help to determine the gender of their offspring. Conventionally, all of these methods require an invasive procedure that places both the mother and pregnancy at risk. However, for sex-linked disorders, the risk/benefit ratio is favorable; therefore, in such cases, gender selection is warranted. The recent introduction of noninvasive techniques for X- and Y-chromosome-bearing sperm sorting now provides another option for couples. However, the method is not absolute in its ability to sort sperm correctly; in many cases, the offspring are not of the desired sex.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Formulas are derived for the probabilities of all possible genotype pairs for X-STRs of any sex combination for seven common relationships. The power of exclusion (PE) of X-STRs in parentage analysis is compared with that of A-STRs of equivalent distribution of allele frequency.

Gluconeogenesis normally requires low insulin levels and the presence of anti-insulin (counterregulatory) hormones together with a coordinated supply of precursors from muscle and adipose tissue to the liver (and kidneys). Muscle provides lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, and other amino acids. Triglycerides in adipose tissue are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, which is a gluconeogenic precursor.

Furthermore, the question \u2018why cannot all excess fuels in the human body be stored as fatty acids?\u2019 is usually probed. There are two main reasons as to why glycogen storage is beneficial over fatty acid storage.

Therefore, the subsequent release of glucose is also controlled to help raise or maintain blood glucose levels.", "Glycerol not lactate is the major net carbon source for gluconeogenesis in mice during both short and prolonged fasting. Several limitations of this study are noted. First, the contribution from glycogen and TCA amino acids might be overestimated since our model assumes both glycogen and TCA amino acids are non-recyclable from glucose during fasting. However, this limitation is expected to have limited impact on our conclusions since the contribution from glycogen is excluded when calculating the GNG rate and the overall contribution from TCA amino acids is not dominant in all three fasting conditions. Second, our current flux model assumes TCA amino acids contribute to GNG via a universal pool of TCA intermediates, though, in reality, liver and peripheral tissues may functionally use two separate pools.

TGs within adipocytes undergo lipolysis to FFAs and glycerol, and there is a general net proteolysis with the release of AAs during the fasting state. The glycerol and gluconeogenic AAs are released from cells and circulate to the liver, where they are subsequently used for gluconeogenesis.

In clinical reality, though, many fluids and electrolytes are administered for other reasons: maintenance fluid therapy, prescribed to provide water and electrolytes when patients are unable to ingest food or fluids; and replacement therapy, for existing or developing losses that cannot be covered by oral or enteral intake. Moreover, an undocumented but potentially substantial volume of fluids is administered unintentionally as a vehicle for intravenous, oral, or enteral medication.

Therefore the individual amount of transdermal fluid loss has to be kept in mind. In patients with a prolonged fluid removal regimen a hypernatremic state was observed frequently.

CHAPTER SUMMARY The flow of intermediates through metabolic pathways is controlled by four regulatory mechanisms: 1) the availability of substrates, 2) allosteric activation and inhibition of enzymes, 3) covalent modification of enzymes, and 4) induction-repression of enzyme synthesis. In the absorptive state, the 2-to 4-hour period after ingestion of a meal, these mechanisms insure that available nutrients are captured as glycogen, triacylglycerol (TAG), and protein (Fig. 24.20). During this interval, transient increases in plasma glucose, amino acids, and TAG occur, the last primarily as components of chylomicrons synthesized by the intestinal mucosal cells.

We will confine our discussion primarily to hepatic functions that relate to gastrointestinal physiology. Metabolic Functions of the Liver Hepatocytes contribute to metabolism of the major nutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Thus the liver plays an important role in glucose metabolism by engaging in gluconeogenesis, conversion of other sugars to glucose.

Conversely, excess ATP can be used during a period of low effort to convert creatine to phosphocreatine.

Finally, why might neurons temporarily allow glycolysis to exceed oxphos in the face of acute energy demand? One speculation is that glycolysis, although it produces a lower yield of ATP than oxphos, provides a faster resupply of energy. Some evolutionary support for this speculation comes from muscle: fast-twitch muscle, requiring the greatest acute supply of energy, tends to be far more glycolytic and to have fewer mitochondria than the slow-twitch muscle used for postural control (;. Neurons possess many mitochondria and rely chronically on them as a major source of ATP, but perhaps, like fast-twitch muscle fibers, they use glycolysis together with the formidable and fast phosphocreatine/creatine kinase system to ensure prompt resupply of ATP.

Degradation: Creatine and creatine phosphate spontaneously cyclize at a slow but constant rate to form creatinine, which is excreted in the urine. The amount excreted is proportional to the total creatine phosphate content of the body and, therefore, can be used to estimate muscle mass.

This terminology refers to the molecular level of respiration, not the respiration of the organism as a whole (i.e., breathing). During anaerobic exercise, the muscles being exercised have insufficient oxygen to meet the demands of the activity, and thus must also use alternate, non-oxygen-dependent processes to produce energy. The muscle does still receive oxygen during anaerobic exercise; the average drop in blood oxygen content throughout the body is likely minimal. Anaerobic exercise begins with muscles utilizing stored creatine phosphate to generate the ATP that produces muscle contraction. After several seconds, further ATP energy is made available to muscles by metabolizing muscle glycogen into pyruvate", "and propagate contractions to other muscle cells they are in contact with. All skeletal muscle and many smooth muscle contractions are facilitated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Muscular activity accounts for much of the body's energy consumption. All muscle cells produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules which are used to power the movement of the myosin heads. Muscles conserve energy in the form of creatine phosphate which is generated from ATP and can regenerate ATP when needed with creatine kinase. Muscles also keep a storage form of glucose in the form of glycogen. Glycogen can be rapidly converted to glucose when energy is required for sustained, powerful contractions.

Perhaps the simplest technique for stoma formation is direct anastomosis of the intestinal conduit to the skin.[] The main problems with this technique include an exposed conduit mucosa, increasing the chance of infection, and bleeding following catheterization.

Most current methods of manipulating DNA, RNA, and proteins rely on prior knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of interest. But how were these sequences determined in the first place? And how are new DNA and RNA molecules sequenced today? In the late 1970s, researchers developed several strategies for determining, simply and quickly, the nucleotide sequence of any purified DNA fragment. The one that became the most widely used is called dideoxy sequencing or Sanger sequencing (Panel 8\u20131). This method was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of many genomes, including those of E. coli, fruit flies, nematode worms, mice, and humans.

This would occur since the number of unique bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. Unfortunately, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible. This is because DNA will survive in the environment for less than one million years and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250-million years old, but these claims are controversial. # Uses in technology ## Genetic engineering Modern biology and biochemistry make", "with the longest protein.

The sample is divided into four reaction tubes, and a small amount of one of the four dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTP) is added to each tube.

As electrons are passed down the ETC, they lose much of their free energy. This energy is used to move H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a H+ gradient that drives the production of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), described on p. 77.

However, the flow of electrons does not directly result in ATP synthesis. A. Chemiosmotic hypothesis The chemiosmotic hypothesis (also known as the Mitchell hypothesis) explains how the free energy generated by the transport of electrons by the ETC is used to produce ATP from ADP + Pi. 1.

As a result they form two molecules of water (H2O). By accepting the electrons, oxygen allows the electron transport chain to continue functioning.

Nevertheless, when the polar regions contract, the equatorial region elongates and regains its sensitivity. Conversely, when a muscle relaxes (\u03b1 motor neuron activity drops) and thus elongates (if its ends are being pulled), a concurrent decrease in \u03b3 motor neuron activity allows the intrafusal fibers to relax (and thus elongate) as well and thereby prevent the tension on the central portion of the intrafusal fiber from reaching a level at which firing of the afferent fibers is saturated.

The sustained initial increase in myoplasmic Ca2+ caused by insertion of a high-frequency doublet stimulus at the beginning of a tetanus gives rise to a straightforward mechanism to explain the observed faster rate of rise of tetanic force in the presence of the doublet. As modeled by the authors, sustaining the early increase in Ca2+ concentration is predicted to increase the binding of Ca2+ to troponin C during the rising phase of tetanic force, which in turn would increase the activation of the thin filament and thus the number of cross-bridges that can bind to actin.

The current view is that proprioception is mainly composed of the receptor signalling of muscle spindles and that the feeling of tension is provided by the muscle receptors called Golgi tendon organs.

Like joint receptors, skin receptors are also fully activated only at the extreme positions of both sides of the range of motion. In contrast, the muscle spindle is unanimously considered to be activated throughout the whole range of motion and can provide proprioceptive information.

The idea of afferent-efferent interactions during kinesthetic perception has been combined recently with the principle of abundance. Indeed, numerous sensory endings of many modalities contribute to perception of a relatively small number of salient mechanical variables. For example, perception of joint position and moment of force can get contributions from articular receptors, sensory endings in muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs in all muscles crossing the joint. All these sensory endings are directly sensitive to local deformation, and the amount of deformation reflects joint position and/or moment magnitude. For example, when a person co-activates muscles acting about a joint without moving the joint, signals from all major peripheral receptors change due to changes in tendon force, joint capsule tension, muscle", "Correlation among proprioception, muscle strength, and\nbalance.

Like the stretch reflex, the tendon reflex is ipsilateral. The sensory receptors for this reflex are called tendon Golgi receptors, which lie within a tendon near its junction with a muscle.

Although it is a dead-end, the conversion of pyruvate to lactate regenerates NAD+, which allows glycolysis to continue in the muscle cell. Lactate diffuses out of the cell and into the blood.The lactate in the bloodstream is converted back into pyruvate in the liver, for use when oxygen is once again present. Certain cells, such as cardiac muscle cells, are highly permeable to lactate. Lactate is converted into pyruvate and metabolised normally (ie: via the citric acid cycle). Since these cells are highly oxygenated, it is unlikely that lactate would accumulate (as is the case in oxygen-starved muscle cells). This also allows circulating glucose to be available to muscle cells. Any excess lactate is taken up by the liver,", "Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex Please Take Over This Page and Apply to be Editor-In-Chief for this topic: There can be one or more than one Editor-In-Chief.

Acetyl-CoA may then be used in the citric acid cycle to carry out cellular respiration, and this complex links the glycolysis metabolic pathway to the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate", "muscle, or the heart. Within the heart, lactate dehydrogenase plays the role of converting lactate back into pyruvate so that the pyruvate can be used again to create more energy. With the mutated enzyme, the overall rate of this conversion is decreased. However, unlike lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, this mutation does not appear to cause any symptoms or health problems linked to this condition. At the present moment, it is unclear why this is the case. Affected individuals are usually discovered only when routine blood tests indicate low LDH levels present within the blood. # Role in muscular fatigue The onset of acidosis during periods of intense exercise is commonly attributed to accumulation of lactic acid. From this reasoning, the idea of lactate production being a primary cause of", "group from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and then is regenerated as the cycle is completed (see Fig. 9.1). Two carbons enter the cycle as acetyl CoA and two leave as CO2. Therefore, the entry of one acetyl CoA into one round of the TCA cycle does not lead to the net production or consumption of intermediates. A. Acetyl CoA production The major source of acetyl CoA for the TCA cycle is the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH complex, or PDHC). However, the PDHC (described below) is not a component of the TCA cycle. Pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, is transported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix by the pyruvate mitochondrial carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the matrix,", "high and insulin is low (for example, as seen in fasting or diabetes). VII. ALTERNATE FATES OF PYRUVATE Pyruvate can be metabolized to products other than lactate. A. Oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl CoA Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the PDHC is an important pathway in tissues with a high oxidative capacity such as cardiac muscle (Fig. 8.24). PDHC irreversibly converts pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, into acetyl CoA, a TCA cycle substrate (see p. 109) and the carbon source for fatty acid synthesis (see p. 183). B. Carboxylation to oxaloacetate Carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase is a biotin-dependent reaction (see Fig. 8.24). This irreversible reaction is important because it replenishes the TCA cycle intermediate and provides substrate for gluconeogenesis (see p. 118). C.", "absent LDH activity. There is currently no specific treatment for this condition. In the case of lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency, mutations to the LDHB gene result in the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase-B subunit that cannot bind to the other subunits to form the complete enzyme. As with lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, this mutation reduces the overall effectiveness in the enzyme. However, there are some major differences between these two cases. The first is the location where the condition manifests itself. With lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency, the highest concentration of B subunits can be found within the cardiac muscle, or the heart. Within the heart, lactate dehydrogenase plays the role of converting lactate back into pyruvate so that the pyruvate can be used again to create more energy. With the", "step 6 begins the energy-generation phase of glycolysis. Because two molecules of aTp are hydrolyzed in the early, energy-investment phase, glycolysis results in the net synthesis of 2 aTp and 2 naDh molecules per molecule of glucose (see also panel 2\u20138). Figure 2\u201347 Two pathways for the anaerobic breakdown of pyruvate. (a) When there is inadequate oxygen, for example, in a muscle cell undergoing vigorous contraction, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to lactate as shown. This reaction regenerates the naD+ consumed in step 6 of glycolysis, but the whole pathway yields much less energy overall than complete oxidation. (B) in some organisms that can grow anaerobically, such as yeasts, pyruvate is C regeneration C converted via acetaldehyde into carbon dioxide and ethanol. again, this pathway CO", "muscle and by cells that lack mitochondria such as RBC. In the Cori cycle, this lactate is taken up by the liver and oxidized to pyruvate that is converted to glucose, which is released back into the circulation (Fig. 10.2). C. Amino acids Amino acids produced by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are the major sources of glucose during a fast. Their metabolism generates \u03b1-keto acids, such as pyruvate that is converted to glucose, or \u03b1-ketoglutarate that can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and form oxaloacetate (OAA), a direct precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). [Note: Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose. This is because of the irreversible", "the use of different start sites in transcription (see p. 473) of the gene that encodes the enzyme. K. Pyruvate reduction to lactate Lactate, formed from pyruvate by LDH, is the final product of anaerobic glycolysis in eukaryotic cells (Fig. 8.21). Reduction to lactate is the major fate for pyruvate in tissues that are poorly vascularized (for example, the lens and cornea of the eye and the kidney medulla) or in RBC that lack mitochondria. 1. Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH.

Because there are only two lobes in the left lung, the likely diagnosis was a left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest radiograph was obtained (eFig. 3.121). The posteroanterior view of the chest demonstrated an area of veil-like opacification throughout the whole of the left lung. Knowing the position of the oblique fissure, any consolidation within the left upper lobe will produce this veil-like shadowing.

Movement of the filaments over each other happens when the globular heads protruding from myosin filaments attach and interact with actin filaments to form crossbridges. The myosin heads tilt and drag along the actin filament a small distance (10-12 nm). The heads then release the actin filament and adopt their original conformation. They can then re-bind to another part of the actin molecule and drag it along further. This process is called crossbridge cycling and is the same for all muscles (see muscle contraction).

The smallest unit of striated muscle is the sarcomere, formed primarily by the interdigitation of myosin-containing thick filaments and actin-containing thin filaments. Muscle contraction occurs by the active sliding of the thin filaments along the thick filaments, powered through the cross-bridge cycle, and initiated by an increase of [Ca2+] that switches on the thin filaments via the troponin complex and tropomyosin. Relaxation occurs when this sliding is stopped by a [Ca2+] decrease.

Troponin is attached to the protein tropomyosin and lies within the groove between actin filaments in muscle tissue. In a relaxed muscle, tropomyosin blocks the attachment site for the myosin crossbridge, thus preventing contraction. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. Some of this calcium attaches to troponin, causing a conformational change that moves tropomyosin out of the way so that the cross bridges can attach to actin and produce muscle contraction.

The increased concentration of Ca2 in the sarcoplasm initiates contraction of the myofibril by binding to the TnC portion of the troponin complex on the thin filaments (see page 316).

Indeed, skeletal muscle fibers have huge amounts of sarcoplasmic reticulum that is extremely rich in Ca pumps (sarco/ER-Ca ATPase) and contains a high buffering capacity (calsequestrin). On the other hand, Ca extrusion through the plasma membrane is very slow, so almost all of the Ca released during contraction is immediately restored after stimulation. Accordingly, twitch contractions can thus be produced repeatedly for hours in the absence of extracellular Ca.

Only one temporary hypoparathyroidism (two months) was observed. In 2 patients the histologic examination revealed a papillar carcinoma. There were no intraoperative deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In personal experience the presence of substernal goiter is an indication for total thyroidectomy.

The intensity of the AS murmur also varies directly with the cardiac output. With a normal cardiac output, a systolic thrill and a grade 4 or higher murmur suggest severe AS.

Continuous Murmur A continuous murmur is predicated on a pressure gradient that persists between two cardiac chambers or blood vessels across systole and diastole.

The committee agreed that this would be a change in practice, would increase pressure on echocardiography services and would offer uncertain benefit.

Evidence suggested that the presence of a systolic heart murmur plus a reduced second heart sound had good specificity for aortic stenosis confirmed by echocardiography.

Usually, the mitral regurgitant murmur shows a constant intensity throughout the systole. In cases with massive mitral regurgitation, however, there is rapid increase in the left atrial pressure in late-systole, which is reflected in the prominent v-waves in the pulmonary artery wedge pressure recordings. In this situation, due to the rapid elevation in the left atrial pressure in late-systole, the intensity of mitral regurgitation tends to decrease in late-systole compared to early-systole.

As discussed in Chapter 5, mutations can never be absolutely avoided because they are an inescapable consequence of fundamental limitations on the accuracy of DNA replication and repair. If a person could live long enough, it is inevitable that at least one of his or her cells would eventually accumulate a set of mutations sufficient for cancer to develop.

Peak flow readings are higher when patients are well, and lower when the airways are constricted. From changes in recorded values, patients and doctors may determine lung functionality, severity of asthma symptoms, and treatment options. The measurement of peak expiratory flow was pioneered by Dr. Basil Martin Wright, who produced the first meter specifically designed to measure this index of lung function. Since the original design of instrument was introduced", "Pulmonary function testing: use of the peak expiratory flow rate in an out-patient or office setting. Thus, the weekly use of peak expiratory flow rate measurements in an out-patient office setting, for the purpose of generating multiple, serial, repetitive measurements to serve as a data base for a particular patient, will from time to time provide useful information helpful in the decision-making process pertaining to therapy. The peak expiratory flow rate maneuver is said to produce information referable primarily to the larger airways (although to a certain extent a patient restricted by inability to take a deep breath may also produce a decreased peak expiratory flow rate measurement), and it is certainly true that other measurements such as complete spirometry, FEV1, FEV25-75, or FEF75-90, or various gas exchange", "assessing the lung functions along with performing the BHT, and PEFR (AIRZONE PEAK EXP FLOW METER).

The CB regurgitates into the blood (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia). The CB is excreted in the urine (which darkens) and is referred to as urinary bilirubin. Urinary urobilinogen is not present because its source is intestinal urobilinogen, which is low. The other choices do not match the data. 1.4.

It is essential that clinicians are able to recognize severe acute hepatitis, decide which diagnostic tests to initiate and when to refer to a pediatric liver specialist or center. The presence of scleral icterus (yellow pigmentation of the white areas of the eye) or other signs of jaundice are more specific manifestations of severe hepatitis and symptoms that warrant urgent testing. Other less specific symptoms include dark urine and/or pale stools, skin irritation, easy bleeding/bruising, muscle aches, lethargic behaviour, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting and fever.

ISOLATED ELEVATION OF SERuM BILIRuBIN unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia The differential diagnosis of isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is limited (Table 58-1). The critical determination is whether the patient is suffering from a hemolytic process resulting in an overproduction of bilirubin (hemolytic disorders and ineffective erythropoiesis) or from impaired hepatic uptake/conjugation of bilirubin (drug effect or genetic disorders). Hemolytic disorders that cause excessive heme production may be either inherited or acquired.

In bacteria, wobble base-pairings make it possible to fit the 20 amino acids to their 61 codons with as Figure 6\u201351 Wobble base-pairing between codons and anticodons. If the nucleotide listed in the first column is present at the third, or wobble, position of the codon, it can base-pair with any of the nucleotides listed in the second column. Thus, for example, when inosine (I) is present in the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon, the tRNA can recognize any one of three different codons in bacteria and either of two codons in eukaryotes. The inosine in tRNAs is formed from the deamination of adenosine (see Figure 6\u201353),", "Codon usage bias Codons are triplets of nucleotides that together specify an amino acid residue in a polypeptide chain. Most organisms use 20 or 21 amino acids to make their polypeptides, which are proteins or protein precursors. Because there are four possible nucleotides, adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T) in DNA, there are 64 possible triplets to recognize only 20 amino acids plus the translation termination signal. Because of this redundancy, all but two amino acids are coded for by more than one triplet. Different organisms often show particular preferences for one of the several codons that encode the same given amino acid. How these preferences arise is a much debated area of molecular evolution. It is generally acknowledged that codon preferences reflect a balance", "System, it is classified as an antiviral. # Biotechnology When designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it can pair with adenine, thymine, or cytosine. This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer's annealing efficiency. However, inosine pairs preferentially with cytidine (C) and its introduction to RNA, e.g. by the action of ADARs, thereby destabilizes double stranded RNA by changing AU base-pairs to IU mismatches (Bass and Weintraub, Cell, 1988). # Fitness Despite lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements. # Feeding Stimulant Inosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some", "of the coded amino acids. Using a modified evolutionary optimization algorithm, we determined the conditions in which the effect on the relative codon usage is maximized. We found that the effect is enhanced by mutational processes generating more adenine and thymine than guanine and cytosine, as well as more purines than pyrimidines. Interestingly, this effect is observed only under an unrestricted model of nucleotide substitution, and disappears when the mutational process is time-reversible. Comparison of the simulation results with data for real protein coding sequences indicates that the impact of selection at the amino acid level on synonymous codon usage cannot be neglected. Furthermore, it can considerably interfere, especially in AT-rich genomes, with other selections on codon usage, e.g., translational efficiency.

It is sometimes directly followed by a rapid inhalation (inspiration), in particular when assessing possible upper airway obstruction.

Intrathoracic pressure is increased relative to atmospheric pressure during exhalation, which tends to collapse the intrathoracic airways and accentuates airway narrowing on expiration. This manifests as expiratory wheeze, prolonged expiratory phase, and increased expiratory work of breathing. In patients with chronic airway infection (e.g., cystic fibrosis), the bronchi become permanently damaged and dilated (bronchiectasis). Patients with bronchiectasis have episodes of cough, often productive of purulent sputum, and may have inspiratory crackles.

Increasing the I:E ratio to 1:3 will result in 1.5 seconds of inspiration and 4.5 seconds of expiration. Thus, a \"higher\" I:E ratio results in less inspiratory time and more expiratory time in the same length of the breath cycle. Standard Volume Control and Pressure Control ventilation modes typically use I:E ratios of 1:2, or as high as 1:3 or 1:4 in certain populations. In these cases, the expiratory phase is set longer than the inspiratory phase to more closely mimic normal physiologic breathing.

There are eight carpal bones, which divide into two rows: a proximal row and a distal row. The proximal row of carpal bones (moving from radial to ulnar) are the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform, while the distal row of carpal bones (also from radial to ulnar) comprises the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate.

With the exception of the metacarpal of the thumb, all movements of the metacarpal bones on the carpal bones are limited. The expansive proximal surfaces of the scaphoid and lunate articulate with the radius to form the wrist joint. The carpal bones do not lie in a flat plane; rather, they form an arch, whose base is directed anteriorly (Fig. 7.94).

During its life, an mRNA molecule may also be processed, edited, and transported prior to translation. Eukaryotic mRNA molecules often require extensive processing and transport, while prokaryotic molecules do not. ## Transcription During transcription, RNA polymerase makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. One notable difference, however, is that eukaryotic RNA polymerase associates with mRNA processing enzymes during transcription so that processing can proceed", "where translation occurs. Therefore, unlike bacteria, eukaryotes undergo uncoupled transcription and translation.Eukaryotic gene transcription also involves the recogni-tion and binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter DNA. However, the interaction between the polymerase and DNA is far more complex in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. Because the majority of studies have been focused on the regulation and functions of proteins, this chapter primarily focuses on how protein-encoding mRNA is made by RNA polymerase II.Translation. DNA directs the synthesis of RNA; RNA in turn directs the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are variable-length polypeptide polymers composed of various combinations of 20 different amino acids and are the working molecules of the cell. The process of decoding information on mRNA to synthesize proteins is called translation (see Fig. 15-1). Translation takes place", "Translation at first sight: the influence of leading codons. Numerous controversies are associated with general understanding of factors that slow the ribosome progression along mRNA, such as codons recognized by rare tRNA species, triplets that require wobble decoding, Shine\u2013Dalgarno (SD)-like sites and codons for particular amino acids. Several difficulties hamper identification of coding sequence features that affect the protein production. Computational analysis of mRNA sequences does not allow one to distinguish the cause of particular sequence bias, be it selection towards translation efficiency of particular mRNA, saving resources for the translation of other mRNAs, or other reasons. A direct estimation of natural mRNAs translation efficiencies by riboseq has produced a wealth of data, but restriction of the sampling space by a limited number of genes encoded in a", "polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryote cells the primary transcript (pre-mRNA) is often processed further via alternative splicing. In this process, blocks of mRNA are cut out and rearranged, to produce different arrangements of the original sequence. ## Translation Eventually, this mature mRNA finds its way to a ribosome, where it is translated. In prokaryotic cells, which have no nuclear compartment, the process of transcription and translation may be linked together. In eukaryotic cells, the site of transcription (the cell nucleus) is usually separated from the site of translation (the cytoplasm), so the mRNA must be transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it can be bound by ribosomes. The mRNA is read by the ribosome as triplet codons, usually beginning with an AUG, or initiator", "the same in a given double helix as will the number of G and C residues. In RNA, thymine (T) is replaced by uracil (U), and the deoxyribose is substituted by ribose. Each protein-coding gene is transcribed into a template molecule of the related polymer RNA, known as messenger RNA or mRNA. This in turn is translated on the ribosome into an amino acid chain or polypeptide. The process of translation requires transfer RNAs specific for individual amino acids with the amino acids covalently attached to them, guanosine triphosphate as an energy source, and a number of translation factors. tRNAs have anticodons complementary to the codons in mRNA and can be \"charged\" covalently with amino acids at their 3' terminal CCA ends. Individual tRNAs are charged with specific", "tRNAs to translate a specific sequence of A, C, G, and U nucleotides in an mRNA molecule into a specific sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule occurs on the ribosome, a large multimolecular machine composed of both protein and ribosomal RNA. All of these processes are described in detail in Chapter 6. DNA molecules as a rule are very large, containing the specifications for thousands of proteins. Special sequences in the DNA serve as punctuation, defining where the information for each protein begins and ends. And individual segments of the long DNA sequence are transcribed into separate mRNA molecules, coding for different proteins. Each such DNA segment represents one gene. A complication is that RNA molecules transcribed from the same DNA segment can often be processed", "Determinants of translation efficiency and accuracy. Current points of debate have to do with the relative role of codon choice and mRNA structure in affecting translation, the relative contribution of control at the level of translation initiation versus elongation, the relative extent of selection for efficiency versus accuracy and the role of random drift versus selection in shaping genes sequence. Even further, translation itself constitutes only one of several steps in the gene expression process, and gene expression as a whole poses only part of the constraints that genes' sequences must obey. The same nucleotide should also support other features such as nucleosome positioning, appropriate splicing and higher order structural elements of the DNA. The apparent redundancy of the genetic code hence facilitates a choice between an astronomical", "energy required for translation of proteins is significant. For a protein containing n amino acids, the number of high-energy Phosphate bonds required to translate it is 4n-1. It is also the process whereby ribosomes use the sequence of codons in mRNA to produce a polypeptide with a particular sequence of amino acids. # Translation by hand It is also possible to translate either by hand (for short sequences) or by computer (after first programming one appropriately, see section below), this allows biologists and chemists to draw out the chemical structure of the encoded protein on paper. First, convert each DNA base to its RNA complement (note that the complement of A is now U): Then split the RNA into triplets (groups of three bases). Note that there are", "Translation (biology) Translation is the second process of protein biosynthesis (part of the overall process of gene expression). Translation occurs in the cytoplasm where the ribosomes are located. Ribosomes are made of a small and large subunit which surrounds the mRNA. In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded to produce a specific polypeptide according to the rules specified by the genetic code. This is the process that converts an mRNA sequence into a chain of amino acids that form a protein. Translation is necessarily preceded by transcription. Translation proceeds in four phases: activation, initiation, elongation and termination (all describing the growth of the amino acid chain, or polypeptide that is the product of translation). In activation, the correct amino acid (AA) is joined to the correct transfer RNA", "sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence using the tRNAs as adaptors to add each amino acid in the correct sequence to the growing end of the polypeptide chain. When a stop codon is encountered, the ribosome releases the finished protein, and its two subunits separate again. These subunits can then be used to start the synthesis of another protein on another mRNA molecule. Ribosomes operate with remarkable efficiency: in one second, a eukaryotic ribosome adds 2 amino acids to a polypeptide chain; the ribosomes of bacterial cells operate even faster, at a rate of about 20 amino acids per second.

Most enzymes function between a pH of 6 and 8; however pepsin in the stomach works best at a pH of 2 and trypsin at a pH of 8. - Substrate Saturation: Increasing the substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction (enzyme activity).

The optimum temperature for most human enzymes is between 35\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Human enzymes start to denature (see p. 20) at temperatures above 40\u00b0C, but thermophilic bacteria found in hot springs have optimum temperatures of 70\u00b0C.

Note that at the maximum velocity, the other factors that affect the rate of reaction (ie. pH, temperature, etc) are at optimal values. # Reaction rate/velocity V The speed V means the number of reactions per second that are catalyzed by an enzyme. With increasing substrate concentration , the enzyme is asymptotically approaching its maximum speed Vmax, but never actually reaching it. Because of that, no for Vmax can be given. Instead, the characteristic value for the enzyme is defined by the substrate concentration at its half-maximum speed (Vmax/2).

In general, we would strongly advice researchers to consider the above\u2010mentioned factors: whether there is an inherent response of the enzyme to the applied stimulus, whether the aim is to reuse the enzyme and the reaction must be reversible, whether the reaction set\u2010up would benefit from immobilizing the enzyme, and, lastly, whether multiple enzymes exhibit cross\u2010reactivity and therefore require orthogonal control of all enzymes involved in the reaction.", "known: some are capable of speeding up reactions by factors of 1014 or more.

The forward and backward reactions will therefore be accelerated by the same factor by an enzyme, and the equilibrium point for the reaction will be unchanged (Figure 2\u201323).

Because this group is deprotonated at alkaline pH, the rate of the reaction declines. 2. pH effect on enzyme denaturation: Extremes of pH can also lead to denaturation of the enzyme, because the structure of the catalytically active protein molecule depends on the ionic character of the amino acid side chains. 3.

The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

In some cases the pathway may be halted entirely to allow the reverse process gluconeogenesis. In glycolysis, the reactions catalyzed by hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase are effectively irreversible in most organisms. In metabolic pathways, such enzymes are potential sites of control, and all these three enzymes serve this purpose in glycolysis.

Enzymes determine what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither progress through the same steps, nor be fast enough to serve the needs of the cell. Indeed, a metabolic pathway such as glycolysis could not exist independently of enzymes. Glucose, for example, can react directly with ATP to become phosphorylated at one or more of its carbons. In the absence of enzymes, this occurs so slowly as to be insignificant. However, if hexokinase is added, these slow reactions continue to take place except that phosphorylation at carbon 6 occurs so rapidly that if the", "well as ribulose 5-phosphate, a carbon source for the synthesis of other molecules.

Glucose-6-phosphate is first isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase. This reaction converts glucose-6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in preparation for phosphorylation to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The addition of the 2nd phosphoryl group to produce Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an irreversible step, and so is used to irreversibly target the glucose-6-phosphate breakdown to provide energy for ATP production via glycolysis. # Fate 3: Storage as Glycogen If blood glucose levels are high, the body needs a way", "kinase and phosphoglycerate kinase Pyruvate kinase and phosphoglycerate kinase catalyze the two substrate-level phosphorylation steps, and produce ATP from ADP. The requirement of ADP to carry out this reaction provides regulation, as, when the cell has plenty of ATP, it will have little ADP so this reaction is unable to happen. ATP decays relatively quickly, even when not used as an energy source; these stages provide the required simple and fast regulation of ATP levels. This control is accentuated, as, after the formation of F1,6bP, many of the glycolysis reactions are energetically unfavorable. The only reactions that are favorable are these two substrate-level phosphorylation steps.

Androgens exist as natural steroids, or are chemically synthesized as anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) or selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). In order to effectively detect misuse of androgens, targeted strategies are used. These targeted strategies rely heavily on mass spectrometry, and detection requires prior knowledge of the targeted structure and its metabolites.

They present a potential for abuse in sports and food-producing animals as an interesting alternative to anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS). These compounds are easily available and could therefore be (mis)used in livestock production as growth promoters. To prevent such practices, dedicated analytical strategies should be developed for specific and sensitive detection of these compounds in biological matrices.

In this study, the mean work and RMS during maximum cycling sprint were also higher in both RW trials than in the control trial. It is possible to assume that adenosine triphosphate utilization was higher in both RW trials than in the control trial, and an increase in adenosine triphosphate resynthesis may", "in the last bout, explain why the glycolytic pathway presented a lower percentage participation compared to the ATP-PCr system in the last two bouts and lower than the oxidative system in the last bout. The increased ATP-PCr relative contribution in the fourth sprint compared to the first is similar to the response observed byusing ten 6-sec sprints interspersed by 30 sec of passive recovery, which indicated that 49.6% participation of phosphocreatine in the first bout and 80.1% contribution in the tenth bout. Basically, the phosphocreatine resynthesis during the intervals (around 75% considering the data from was able to compensate for the depletion during the previous bout and to provide enough energy to keep its absolute participation constant in the four bouts; as the glycolytic system decreased its participation,", "has been previously suggested that during recovery from high intensity intermittent exercise, aerobic metabolism is involved in a major way to restore homeostasis by the resynthesis of phosphocreatine (PCr) and the removal of both accumulated intracellular Pi and lactate []. Many authors have highlighted the importance of PCr stores to regenerate ATP during repeated sprint exercise and demonstrated that the maintenance of a high level of performance is mainly associated with the resynthesis of PCr, which is itself strongly dependant on recovery duration]. Harris et al. [] reported that in humans the estimated half-time resynthesis of PCr during recovery was about 30-60 s. In addition, Dawson et al. [] found that after the 1x6 s sprint PCr concentration was respectively 55% (at 10 s), 69% (at 30 s)", "in skeletal muscle is small and capable of supporting only a few contractions if not replenished. This pool, however, is continually replenished during contraction, as described later, so that even when the muscle fatigues, ATP stores are only modestly decreased. Muscle cells contain creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise. The enzyme creatine phosphokinase catalyzes the reaction: Although much of the creatine phosphokinase is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of", "most representative can be presented in a textbook of neurology. The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "with these questions, students received a list of materials available for the experiment. In the classroom, they proposed two protocols of eight 30-m sprints at maximum speed, one protocol with pauses of 120 s and the other protocol with pauses of 20 s between sprints. Their performances were analyzed through the velocity registered by photocells. Blood lactate was analyzed before the first sprint and after the eighth sprint. Blood uric acid was analyzed before exercise and 15 and 60 min after exercises. When discussing the data, students concluded that phosphocreatine restoration is time dependent, and this fact influenced the steady level of performance in the protocol with pauses of 120 s compared with the performance decrease noted in the protocol with pauses of 20 s. As the blood", "by its name, anaerobic glycolysis does not require oxygen, but NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter III -The nutritional need of humans 2.

An adult man weighing 65 kg and exercising moderate activity would recycle an estimated 70 kg of ATP every day. On the other hand, the overall amount of ATP present in his body at any time would probably not exceed 100 g, an energy reserve equivalent to approximately two minutes (a few seconds for the brain). This is because the utilization and recycling of ATP is extremely rapid, and explains the speed at which", "intervals between the high intensity efforts and sprints could play an important role in maintaining performance, such as removing intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) and the resynthesis of phosphocreatine stores (PCr). In addition, when maximum efforts are repeated with short rest intervals, the aerobic contribution increases during the exercise and can be decisive in maintaining high intensity performance (;. Thus, it seems possible that the best performance indices in high intensity intermittent efforts are dependent on aerobic fitness. This could be due to the RAST consisting of forward sprints, without changes of direction, which little resemble efforts in soccer. Furthermore, the actions in the game could be sustained by the contribution of the aerobic metabolism (i.e., a high relationship between aerobic fitness and actions in the match).", "is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store.

KEY POINTS: Three weeks of intensified training and mild energy deficit in elite race walkers increases peak aerobic capacity independent of dietary support. Adaptation to a ketogenic low carbohydrate, high fat (LCHF) diet markedly increases rates of whole-body fat oxidation during exercise in race walkers over a range of exercise intensities. The increased rates of fat oxidation result in reduced economy (increased oxygen demand for a given speed) at velocities that translate to real-life race performance in elite race walkers. In contrast to training with diets providing chronic or periodised high carbohydrate availability, adaptation to an LCHF diet impairs performance in elite endurance athletes despite a significant improvement", "utilization scales exponentially to relative exercise power output with a greater gain in glycogen than in glucose use at high power.

Their high levels of mitochondrial oxidative enzymes are demonstrated by their strong succinic dehydrogenase and NADH-TR histochemical staining reactions as described previously (see Fig. 11.3).

Additionally, the low contraction velocity means that these slow motor units are also heavily recruited in precise finite motor activities and in opposing gravity. Fast fatigable motor units generate more force and have higher velocities than slow motor units, both because they have the highest number of fibers and because the individual fibers have the largest cross-sectional area (CSA) and the highest contractile velocity.

Fast muscle, in contrast, is recruited for activities that require faster movements, more force, or both (see Fig. 12.15 ). Weightlifting, for example, can require a lot of power for short duration. In order to meet the demands for more force, additional motor units are recruited. In comparison with slow motor units, the fast motor units typically contain more muscle fibers (see Table 12.2 ). Fast muscle fibers also have a larger diameter than do slow muscle fibers. Thus recruitment of fast motor units can help meet the increased demands of burst activities such as weightlifting.

Type IIb fibers predominate in the fast muscle of small mammals that have to accelerate their limbs very fast against little load. Human type IIx (aka IIB) are our fastest fibers.

The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity. In addition to the difference in myosin ATPase activity, fast-and slow-twitch muscles also differ in metabolic activity, fiber diameter, motor unit size, sensitivity to tetany, and recruitment pattern. 6.

It concerns the initial and final energy states of the reaction components, not the reaction mechanism or how much time it takes for the chemical change to occur. Bioenergetics makes use of a few basic ideas from the field of thermodynamics, particularly the concept of free energy. Because changes in free", "VIII. ENZYME REGULATION The regulation of the reaction velocity of enzymes is essential if an organism is to coordinate its numerous metabolic processes. The rates of most enzymes are responsive to changes in substrate concentration, because the intracellular level of many substrates is in the range of the Km. Thus, an increase in substrate concentration prompts an increase in reaction rate, which tends to return the concentration of substrate toward normal. In addition, some enzymes with specialized regulatory functions respond to allosteric effectors and/or covalent modification or they show altered rates of enzyme synthesis (or degradation) when physiologic conditions are changed. A. Allosteric enzymes Allosteric enzymes are regulated by molecules called effectors that bind noncovalently at a site other than the active site. These enzymes are almost always", "its binding restores the energetically favorable monomer\u2013monomer contacts of a symmetric dimer (this also completely inactivates the enzyme). As an alternative to this induced fit model for a cooperative allosteric transition, we can view such a symmetric enzyme as having only two possible conformations, corresponding to the \u201cenzyme on\u201d and \u201cenzyme off\u201d structures in Figure 3\u201360. In this view, ligand binding perturbs an all-or-none equilibrium between these two states, thereby changing the proportion of active molecules. Both models represent true and useful concepts. Proteins are regulated by more than the reversible binding of other molecules. A second method that eukaryotic cells use extensively to regulate a protein\u2019s function is the covalent addition of a smaller molecule to one or more of its amino acid side chains. The most", "charges, the enzyme-catalyzed addition of a phosphate group to a protein can cause a major conformational change in the protein by, for example, attracting a cluster of positively charged amino acid side chains.

This diagram illustrates how the conformation of one subunit can influence that of its neighbor.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another. This is often referred to as \"the lock and key\" model. However, while this model explains enzyme specificity, it fails to explain the stabilization of the transition state that enzymes achieve. The \"lock and key\" model has proven inaccurate and the induced fit model is the most currently accepted enzyme-substrate-coenzyme figure. ### Induced fit model In 1958 Daniel Koshland suggested a modification to the lock and key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continually reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site, the amino acid side chains which make up the active site are moulded", "result in \"part-of-the-sites binding (and reactivity)\", offer possible explanations why it may have a beneficial role in enzyme function, and point to experimental problems in documenting this behaviour. We describe some cases, for which such a mechanism was first reported and later disproved. We also give several examples of enzymes, for which this mechanism seems to be well documented, and profitable. A majority of enzymes identified in this study as half-of-the-sites binding (or reactive) use it in the flip-flop version, in which \"half-of-the-sites\" refers to a particular moment in time. In general, the various variants of the mechanism seems to be employed often by oligomeric enzymes for allosteric regulation to enhance the efficiency of enzymatic reactions in many key metabolic pathways.", "a standard way to any other amino acid in the set; attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character. Each of the protein molecules is a polypeptide, created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence. Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface (Figure 1\u20137A), these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds. In this way they direct the vast majority of chemical processes in the cell (Figure 1\u20137B).

During anaerobic exercise, the muscles being exercised have insufficient oxygen to meet the demands of the activity, and thus must also use alternate, non-oxygen-dependent processes to produce energy. The muscle does still receive oxygen during anaerobic exercise; the average drop in blood oxygen content throughout the body is likely minimal.

The duration of these breaks determines which energy system the body utilizes. Performing a series of exercises with little or no rest between them, referred to as \"circuit training\", will draw energy mostly from the aerobic energy system.

To meet these goals, competitive endurance athletes undertake a prodigious volume of training, with a large proportion performed at intensities that are close to or faster than race pace and highly dependent on carbohydrate (CHO)-based fuels to sustain rates of muscle energy production [i.e., match rates of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis with rates of resynthesis].

Because the anaerobic muscle fibre uses its fuel faster than the blood and intracellular restorative cycles can resupply it, the maximum number of repetitions is limited.

This depolarization spreads across the surface of the muscle fiber into transverse tubules, eliciting the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus initiating muscle contraction.

Activation of the nicotinic receptor opens its intrinsic sodium/potassium channel, causing sodium to rush in and potassium to trickle out.

The subglottic space extends from the inferior margin of the vocal cords to the lower border of cricoid cartilage; this area is the narrowest part of the airway. The subglottic space is vulnerable to mechanical trauma, particularly intubation of longer duration. The laryngeal nerves enter the larynx through the posterior cricoid cartilage ring. The resection of the entire cricoid cartilage ring is impossible, using the current techniques available, without damaging both recurrent laryngeal nerves. Such damage would result in total loss of bilateral vocal cord function. These characteristics of the trachea pose a challenge to thoracic surgeons performing tracheotomies, tracheal closures, or resections.", "Surgery of the Trachea. The trachea proper starts just inferior to the cricoid and extends to the main carina, some 10\u201312 cm distal. The shape of the normal trachea is an extended half circle with the posterior portion nearly flat and made of soft tissue, which comprises the membranous portion. The anterior portion of the trachea is made up of a series of cartilaginous rings with a membrane between each ring. The trachea is partially intra-thoracic and partially extrathoracic, as its position in the chest moves superiorly and inferiorly with extension and flexion of the neck, respectively (Fig. 3). This mobility decreases with age, which is an important consideration in tracheal resection and reconstruction, since this mobility is used to reduce tension on all tracheal anastomoses after resection.", "Laryngeal wounds A distal tracheostomy is mandatory. Small wounds are debrided and the mucosa and cartilage closed with absorbable sutures; the knot is placed external to the laryngeal cavity. For an injury to the cricoid cartilage, the tissues around the first tracheal ring should be mobilized to close the defect. A stent such as an endotracheal tube should be used to prevent stenosis of the larynx and kept in place for 14 days.

In the past, after several attempts at extubation, a tracheostomy is performed with definitive therapy instituted later. Since the first report of the Anterior Cricoid Split (ACS) in 1980, the extubation success rate of all centres average about 77%.

Fatigue of voluntary muscular effort is a complex phenomenon. To date, relatively little attention has been placed on the role of the central nervous system (CNS) in fatigue during exercise despite the fact that the unwillingness to generate and maintain adequate CNS drive to the working muscle is the most likely explanation of fatigue for most people during normal activities. Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain CNS fatigue. Hypotheses have been developed for several neurotransmitters including serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine), dopamine, and acetylcholine.

When the ambient temperature was increased, dopaminergic and combined dopaminergic and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition appeared to override a safety switch, allowing subjects to push harder and become much warmer, without changing their perception.

The cell-to-cell lactate shuttle was introduced in 1984 and has been repeatedly supported by studies using a variety of experimental approaches. Because of its large mass and metabolic capacity, skeletal muscle is probably the major component of the lactate shuttle in terms of both production and consumption. Muscles exercising in a steady state are avid consumers of lactate, using most of the lactate as an oxidative fuel. Cardiac muscle is highly oxidative and readily uses lactate as a fuel.

The efficiency of by-product removal by muscles can improve through training. # Anaerobic biochemistry Anaerobics are activities that are carried out 'without oxygen'. This terminology refers to the molecular level of respiration, not the respiration of the organism as a whole (i.e., breathing). During anaerobic exercise, the muscles being exercised have insufficient oxygen to meet the demands of the activity, and thus must also use alternate, non-oxygen-dependent processes to produce energy. The muscle does still receive oxygen during anaerobic exercise; the average drop in blood oxygen content throughout the body is likely minimal. Anaerobic exercise begins with muscles utilizing stored creatine phosphate to generate the ATP that produces muscle contraction.

As mentioned, such areas are best delineated by proceeding from the region of impaired sensation toward the normal. The changes may be confirmed by dragging a pin lightly over the parts in question. Areas of reduced pinprick sensation can be corroborated by the thermal sense examination, as below.

An alternative way to test cold sensation is to touch a metal object, such as a tuning fork at room temperature, to the skin. For testing warm temperatures, the tuning fork or another metal object may be held under warm water of the desired temperature and then used.

The External Assessment Centre considered that the Bracewell et al. (2012) study was the highest quality study and most closely matched the decision problem. It noted the results showed that there were no statistically significant differences in diagnostic accuracy between VibraTip and the 10 g monofilament or the 128 Hz tuning fork in the detection of peripheral neuropathy. The External Assessment Centre considered the optimisation of the thresholds for each device a limitation of this study, because it is not clear how generalisable these thresholds are to clinical practice. It also highlighted that it is unclear whether the study was sufficiently statistically powered to reliably conclude non\u2011inferiority. ## Committee considerations The Committee noted the clinical evidence base", "Realize that there is a fair amount of inter-individual variation with regards to the specifics of innervation. Also, recognize that often only parts of nerves may become dysfunctional, leading to partial motor or sensory deficits. As such, the patterns of loss are rarely as \"pure\" as might be suggested by the precise descriptions of nerves and their innervations. ## Sensory Testing Sensory testing of the face is discussed in the section on Cranial Nerves. Testing of the extremities focuses on the two main afferent pathways: Spinothalamics and Dorsal Columns. - Spinothalamics: These nerves detect pain, temperature and crude touch. They travel from the periphery, enter the spinal cord and then cross to the other side of the cord within one or two vertebral levels of their entry point", "relevance to the scope. It also agreed that, although it would appear that VibraTip has a diagnostic accuracy comparable with that of the 10 g monofilament and the tuning fork, there remained some uncertainties. The Committee judged that these uncertainties were important, because even small differences in diagnostic accuracy might have serious consequences concerning post-diagnosis outcomes for these patients. The Committee concluded that further evidence based on a high quality diagnostic accuracy study was needed to assess the clinical effectiveness of this technology. The Committee discussed the comparators specified in the scope and received expert advice that the appropriate comparators for VibraTip are the 10 g monofilament and the calibrated tuning fork. Expert advice indicated the 10 g monofilament was routinely used in primary care, but practice varied", "Diagnostic criteria for small fibre neuropathy in clinical practice and research. All patients underwent a thorough bedside clinical evaluation. Presence and distribution of negative and positive sensory and signs were recorded using a comparative assessment of affected and non-affected skin areas to differentiate the quality of the altered sensation and define dermatomeric, mono/multineuropathic and polyneuropathic distribution. Vibratory sensation was quantified using the 128 Hz graduated tuning fork. Cutaneous sensory signs were assessed asking the patient to keep the eyes closed and to report the sensation induced by tactile stimuli and gently brushing with cotton bud and flat tip brush (dynamic allodynia), punctate skin stimulation with a stick or pin (punctate allodynia), prickling with disposable needle (hyperalgesia), cooling/warming with cold/warm water tube (thermal allodynia), superficial and deep mechanical sensation", "Additional/Special Testing for Dorsal Column Dysfunction Testing Two Point Discrimination: Patients should normally be able to distinguish simultaneous touch with 2 objects which are separated by at least 5mm.

Performing resistance exercise immediately prior to aerobic exercise also helps reduce hypoglycemia risk, rather than performing aerobic exercise alone or aerobic exercise followed by resistance exercise (46). Exercise performed late in the day or in the evening can be associated with increased risk of overnight hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes (76). To reduce this risk, the bedtime intermediate or long-acting injected insulin dose, or overnight basal insulin infusion rate may be reduced by approximately 20% from bedtime to 3 AM for CSII users. # Minimizing risks related to hyperglycemia Glucose levels can rise with brief intense exercise, such", "(PG) levels are <7.0 mmol/L (54,55). Knowledge of the acute effects of exercise is essential. Low-to moderate-intensity exercise lowers BG levels both during and after the activity, increasing the risk of a hypoglycemic episode. These effects on BG levels can be modified by altering diet, insulin, and the type and timing of physical activity. In contrast, high-intensity exercise raises BG levels during and immediately after the event but may result in hypoglycemia hours later. SMBG before, during and after exercise is important for establishing response to exercise and guiding the appropriate management of exercise.

A level of <3.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) is usually described as a hypoglycemic attack (low blood sugar). Most diabetics know when they're going to \"go hypo\" and usually are able to eat some food or drink something sweet to raise levels. A patient who is hyperglycemic (high glucose) can also become temporarily hypoglycemic, under certain conditions (e.g. not eating regularly, or after strenuous exercise, followed by fatigue).

In patients with diabetes, the ADA recommends 150 min/week (distributed over at least 3 days) of moderate aerobic physical activity with no gaps longer than 2 days. The exercise regimen should also include resistance training. Despite its benefits, exercise presents challenges for individuals with DM because they lack the normal glucoregulatory mechanisms (normally, insulin falls and glucagon rises during exercise). Skeletal muscle is a major site for metabolic fuel consumption in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, aerobic exercise greatly increases fuel requirements. Individuals with type 1 DM are prone to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia during exercise, depending on the preexercise plasma glucose, the circulating insulin level, and the level of exercise-induced catecholamines.", "does not reduce insulin level enough during the activity to adequately attenuate hypoglycemia risk (88). A more aggressive basal rate reduction, such as basal rate suspension at exercise onset is somewhat effective, although blood glucose levels may still drop markedly at the start of exercise (79). As such, additional carbohydrates may still be needed even following basal rate reductions. For people on insulin injections, in addition to lowering the mealtime bolus before exercise, exercise-associated hypoglycemia can be attenuated by reducing total daily basal insulin by 20% for days when they are physically active (89).

This terminology refers to the molecular level of respiration, not the respiration of the organism as a whole (i.e., breathing). During anaerobic exercise, the muscles being exercised have insufficient oxygen to meet the demands of the activity, and thus must also use alternate, non-oxygen-dependent processes to produce energy. The muscle does still receive oxygen during anaerobic exercise; the average drop in blood oxygen content throughout the body is likely minimal. Anaerobic exercise begins with muscles utilizing stored creatine phosphate to generate the ATP that produces muscle contraction. After several seconds, further ATP energy is made available to muscles by metabolizing muscle glycogen into pyruvate", "glucose unit would produce 32 units of ATP via glycolysis and aerobic respiration, questioning whether the saving of one ATP would be a reason for an alternative route.

A good example would be the oxidation of glucose (a monosaccharide) in aerobic respiration. The energy released in this equation is about 2880 kJ per mol, which is conserved in regenerating 38 ATP from 38 ADP per glucose. This is a factor of 19 times more energy per sugar molecule than the typical anaerobic reaction generates. Eukaryotic organisms (everything but bacteria) only get a net gain of 36 ATP regenerated from ADP in this process, due to an additional membrane that must be crossed by active transport.

Aerobic glycogen and fatty acid metabolism provide the major source of ATP and constitute the only source during moderate intensity exercise.

Guidelines from Ayurveda on exercise or Vyaayaam, clearly correlate with this concept and indicate that one should exercise until half of his energy is consumed [].

During short, continuous high-intensity exercises (lasting \u223c120 s), ATP is maximally resynthesized through aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in order to maintain the required power output. Thus, several tests have been proposed in the literature to assess the energy metabolism profile during exhaustive exercise. In particular, it is believed that measurement of muscle metabolites could provide relevant information regarding anaerobic metabolism. However, determination of the maximum amount of ATP that can be resynthesized by breakdown of phosphocreatine and intramuscular glycogen, using small muscle biopsy samples, can result in a limited representation of anaerobic metabolism activation in all the muscles recruited during exercise.

These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate). As discussed later, muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise is associated with depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle. Fatty acids represent an important source of energy for muscle", "Glycogen turnover forms lactate during exercise. The power needs of muscle are supplied by rapid anaerobic glycogenolytic ATP generation.

As mentioned, one can distinguish true weakness from unwillingness to cooperate, feigned or neurasthenic weakness, and inhibition of movement by pain. To quantitate the degree of weakness, a rating scale may be required. Widely used is the one proposed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) of Great Britain, which recognizes 6 grades of muscle strength as follows: 2\u2014Active movement only with gravity eliminated 3\u2014Full movement against gravity but cannot offer resistance to manual muscle opposition Further gradations may be added, specified as", "6 grades of muscle strength as follows: 2\u2014Active movement only with gravity eliminated 3\u2014Full movement against gravity but cannot offer resistance to manual muscle opposition Further gradations may be added, specified as 4+ for barely detectable weakness and 4for easily detected weakness, 3+ and 3-, and so on.

Recently, several reports have been published in support of the idea that protein synthesis occurs in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

The significance and broad implications of this phenomenon require that the experimental evidence used to support it be carefully evaluated. Here, we critique the published evidence in support of, or in opposition to, the question of whether translation occurs in the nucleus.

In eukaryotes, transcription necessarily occurs in the nucleus, where the cell's DNA is sequestered; the RNA molecule produced by the polymerase is known as the primary transcript and must undergo post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. The splicing of introns present within the transcribed region is a modification unique to eukaryotes; alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells. ## Translation Translation is the process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes", "how long, on average, does a molecule of the protein remain bound to the dnA? how long does it take to make each molecule of mRnA or protein, and how quickly does each type of molecule get degraded? As explained in chapter 8, mathematical modeling shows that we need quantitative answers to all these and other questions before we can predict the behavior of even this single-gene system. For different parameter values, the system may settle to a unique steady state; or it may behave as a switch, capable of existing in one or another of a set of alternative states; or it may oscillate; or it may show large random fluctuations.

The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes. ## Cell compartmentalization The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane.

This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for", "polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryote cells the primary transcript (pre-mRNA) is often processed further via alternative splicing. In this process, blocks of mRNA are cut out and rearranged, to produce different arrangements of the original sequence. ## Translation Eventually, this mature mRNA finds its way to a ribosome, where it is translated. In prokaryotic cells, which have no nuclear compartment, the process of transcription and translation may be linked together. In eukaryotic cells, the site of transcription (the cell nucleus) is usually separated from the site of translation (the cytoplasm), so the mRNA must be transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it can be bound by ribosomes.

Tremor consists of alternating contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles in an oscillating, rhythmic manner. It can be most prominent at rest (rest tremor), on assuming a posture (postural tremor), or on actively reaching for a target (kinetic tremor).

The differential effect of drugs on tremor and bradykinesia suggest that they must have separate mechanisms.

A postural tremor occurs with the limbs and trunk actively maintained in certain positions (such as holding the arms outstretched) and may persist throughout active movement.

The actions of insulin on the parenchyma of peripheral tissues are diverse, and paramount among them is the regulation of glucose metabolism. The major function of insulin in muscle and adipose tissues is to increase their uptake of carbon sources and store them for the energetic needs of tissue. With glucose transport into these tissues being rate limiting for its storage (as glycogen and triglycerides, respectively), it is no surprise that insulin regulates glucose uptake. This is brought about by an exquisite series of signals that cooperate in bringing glucose transporters (GLUT4 isoform) to the cell surface. This process is generically known as GLUT4 translocation, and 30 years of research has revealed regulation at a number of stages in this intracellular", "diffusion up a concentration gradient. Correct answer = C. Glucose uptake in the liver, brain, muscle, and adipose tissue is down a concentration gradient, and the diffusion is facilitated by tissue-specific glucose transporters (GLUT). In adipose and muscle tissues, insulin is required for glucose uptake. Moving glucose against a concentration gradient requires energy and is seen with the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) of intestinal mucosal cells. .5. Given that the Km of glucokinase for glucose is 10 mM, whereas that of hexokinase is 0.1 mM, which isozyme will more closely approach Vmax at the normal blood glucose concentration of 5 mM? Correct answer = Hexokinase. Km (Michaelis constant) is that substrate concentration that gives one half Vmax (maximal velocity). When blood glucose concentration is 5 mM, hexokinase", "for gluconeogenesis. Thus gluconeogenesis requires an integration of catabolic pathways in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes with anabolic gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Gluconeogenesis eventually supplants glycogenolysis and can continue as long as precursors flow into the liver. Glucose sparing represents the other general process that contributes to maintenance of adequate circulating glucose levels during the fasting phase. Glucose sparing means the switching of fuel utilization from glucose to a nongluconeogenic fuel in most cell types, but especially in skeletal muscle, which represents the potentially largest single consumer of glucose. First, the uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle and adipocytes is greatly reduced because the GLUT4 transporter isoform exists in an intracellular CHAPTER 39 Hormonal Regulation of Energy Metabolism Fig. 39.3B) during the fasting phase. Thus alternative fuels need to be", "Insulin-independent glucose transport regulates insulin sensitivity. The glucose transport proteins (GLUT1 and GLUT4) facilitate glucose transport into insulin-sensitive cells. GLUT1 is insulin-independent and is widely distributed in different tissues. GLUT4 is insulin-dependent and is responsible for the majority of glucose transport into muscle and adipose cells in anabolic conditions. We suggest the hypothesis that insulin resistance is dependent on whether glucose is entering through GLUT1 or GLUT4 and on the two functional compartments of glucose 6-phosphate formation within the cell. Glucose entering the muscle cell through GLUT4 and phosphorylated by hexokinase II is mainly directed to glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. If glucose is entering through GLUT1 and phosphorylated by hexokinase I, the glucose 6-phosphate so formed is available for all metabolic pathways, including the hexosamine pathway. Hexosamines have", "Exploring the whereabouts of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle (review). The glucose transporter GLUT4 is expressed in muscle, fat cells, brain and kidney. In contrast to other glucose transporters, GLUT4 in unstimulated cells is mostly intracellular. Stimuli such as insulin and muscle contractions then cause the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface. Questions related to GLUT4 storage compartments, trafficking to the surface membrane, and nature of the intracellular pools, have kept many groups busy for the past 20 years. Yet, one of the main questions in the field remains the universality of GLUT4 features. Can one extrapolate work done on fat cells to muscle or brain? Or vice-versa? Can one use cultures to predict GLUT4 behaviour in fully differentiated tissues? This review summarizes the authors' knowledge of GLUT4", "= E. Vigorously contracting skeletal muscle shows an increase in the reduction of pyruvate to lactate compared with resting muscle. The levels of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) increase and exceed the oxidative capacity of the electron transport chain. Consequently, the levels of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) increase. The concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is not a key regulatory factor in skeletal muscle. .4.

At rest, muscle accounts for ~25% of the oxygen (O2) consumption of the body, whereas during vigorous exercise, it is responsible for up to 90%. This underscores the fact that skeletal muscle, despite its potential for transient periods of anaerobic glycolysis, is an oxidative tissue. A. Carbohydrate metabolism 1. Increased glucose transport: The transient increase in plasma glucose and insulin after a carbohydrate-rich meal leads to an increase in glucose transport into muscle cells (myocytes) by GLUT-4 (see p. 97 and Fig. 24.7, ), thereby reducing blood glucose. Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase and metabolized to meet the energy needs of myocytes. 2. Increased glycogenesis: The increased insulin/glucagon ratio and the availability of glucose 6-phosphate favor glycogen synthesis, particularly if", "transmembrane segments. # Tissue distribution ## Skeletal muscle In striated skeletal muscle cells, GLUT4 concentration in the plasma membrane can increase as a result of either exercise or muscle contraction. During exercise, the body needs to convert glucose to ATP to be used as energy. As G-6-P concentrations decrease, hexokinase becomes less inhibited, and the glycolytic and oxidative pathways that make ATP are able to proceed. This also means that muscle cells are able to take in more glucose as its intracellular concentrations decrease. In order to increase glucose levels in the cell, GLUT4 is the primary transporter used in this facilitated diffusion. Although muscle contractions function in a similar way and also induce the translocation of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane, the two skeletal muscle processes obtain", "the uptake of glucose into the cells. GLUT4 is stored in the cell in transport vesicles, and is quickly incorporated into the plasma membrane of the cell when insulin binds to membrane receptors. Under conditions of low insulin, most GLUT4 is sequestered in intracellular vesicles in muscle and fat cells. As the vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, GLUT4 transporters are inserted and become available for transporting glucose, and glucose absorption increases. The genetically engineered muscle insulin receptor knock\u2010out (MIRKO) mouse was designed to be insensitive to glucose uptake caused by insulin, meaning that GLUT4 is absent. Mice with diabetes or fasting hyperglycemia, however, were found to be immune to the negative effects of the insensitivity.

When oxygen is present, acetyl-CoA is produced from pyruvate. If oxygen is not present the cell undergoes fermentation of the pyruvate molecule. If acetyl-CoA is produced the molecule then enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) inside the mitochondrial matrix, and gets oxidized to CO2 while at the same time reducing NAD to NADH.

CYCLE OVERVIEW The tricarboxylic acid cycle ([TCA cycle] also called the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle) plays several roles in metabolism. It is the final pathway where the oxidative catabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids converge, their carbon skeletons being converted to carbon dioxide (CO2), as shown in cycle. The TCA cycle is an aerobic pathway, because oxygen (O2) is required as the final electron acceptor. Reactions such as the catabolism of some amino acids generate intermediates of the cycle and are called anaplerotic (from the Greek for \u201cfilling up\u201d) reactions. The TCA cycle also provides intermediates for a number of important anabolic reactions, such as", "Ketone bodies are an alternate to the use of glucose, and, thus, dependence on glucose increases. Because FA \u03b2-oxidation supplies the NADH and the nucleoside triphosphates needed for gluconeogenesis, glucose production decreases. The result is a hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Recall that this was seen with medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. Case 4: Answers to Review Questions RQ1.Answer = D. The rise in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in the mitochondria decreases the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid (FA) oxidation, and gluconeogenesis. NADH inhibits the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction, the key regulated step of the TCA cycle, and the \u03b1ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction (see figure at bottom right). It also favors the reduction of oxaloacetate (OAA) to malate (not malate to OAA), decreasing the availability of OAA for condensation with", "energy (as ATP) and intermediates for other metabolic pathways. Glycolysis is at the hub of carbohydrate metabolism because virtually all sugars, whether arising from the diet or from catabolic reactions in the body, can ultimately be converted to glucose (Fig. 8.9A). Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate is reduced to lactate as NADH is oxidized to NAD+ (Fig. 8.9C). This conversion of glucose to lactate is called anaerobic", "oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids. Fats are catabolised by hydrolysis to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Amino acids are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide", "processes required in different tissues are not the same. For example, nerve cells, which are probably the most fastidious cells in the body, maintain almost no reserves of glycogen or fatty acids and rely almost entirely on a constant Figure 2\u201362 The nine essential amino acids. These cannot be synthesized by human cells and so must be supplied in the diet.

Pyruvic acid is converted into acetyl-coenzyme A, which is the main input for a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle. Pyruvate is also converted to oxaloacetate by an anaplerotic reaction which replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates; alternatively, the oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis. These reactions are named after Hans Adolf Krebs, the biochemist awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize for physiology, jointly with Fritz Lipmann, for research into metabolic processes. The cycle is also called the citric acid cycle, because citric acid is one of the intermediate compounds formed during the reactions. If insufficient oxygen is available, the acid is broken down anaerobically, creating lactic", "is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized.

Central signals are then relayed to the pancreas through the efferent autonomic nervous system, indirectly inducing insulin secretion in response to gastric stimuli.

However it must be underlined that the insulin secretory effect of most nutrients requires the presence of glucose which is consequently a permissive factor. A number of gastrointestinal and pancreatic hormones stimulate, in presence of glucose, insulin secretion and play an essential role during food intake, which results in a better fitting of insulin secretion to energy supply.

The levels of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) increase and exceed the", "to glucose when energy is required for sustained, powerful contractions. Within the voluntary skeletal muscles, the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules in the process (note that in aerobic conditions, lactate is not formed; instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle). Muscle cells also contain globules of fat, which are used for energy during aerobic exercise. The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP and reach peak efficiency, and requires many more biochemical steps, but produces significantly more ATP than anaerobic glycolysis. Cardiac muscle on the other hand, can readily consume any of the three macronutrients (protein, glucose and fat) aerobically without a 'warm up' period and always", "gives 170 mmol/second, which is much more than around 1 mmol/second during rest.Despite the more than 100-fold increase in the rate of ATP consumption from rest to maximal-intensity exercise, the energetic demands of muscles in endurance sports are usually satisfied without depleting intracellular ATP.Three sources are available for ATP production: 1) ATP can be produced aerobically in the mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation (aerobic energy), 2) ATP can be produced by anaerobic synthesis due to glycolysis/glycogenolysis (lactic energy), and 3) ATP can be produced by phosphocreatine (PCr) breakdown to creatine (Cr) (adenosine diphosphate + PCr gives ATP + Cr in the creatine kinase [CK] reaction) (alactic energy). The maximal amount of anaerobic energy that can be utilized is proportional to the sum of the maximum amount of Cr and", "step from pyruvate to Acetyl CoA, in order to enter the mitochondria, where it is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide and water by pyruvate decarboxylase (oxidative decarboxylation) and the set of enzymes of the citric acid cycle. The products of pyruvate are sequentially dehydrogenated as they pass through the cycle, powering the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. In turn, the NADH is ultimately oxidized by an electron transport chain, using oxygen as final electron acceptor to produce a large amount of ATP via the action of the ATP synthase complex, a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. A small amount of ATP is also produced by substrate-level phosphorylation during the citric acid cycle. ## Anaerobic respiration In animals, including humans, metabolism is primarily aerobic. However, under hypoxic (or partially-anaerobic)", "The kinetics of anaerobic metabolism following the initiation of high-intensity exercise. A mathematical study is made of the kinetics of anaerobic metabolism following the initiation of high-intensity exercise. Power and energy relationships are proposed for oxygen-independent glycolysis, phosphocreatine utilisation and the utilisation of endogenous ATP. The power relations consist of two components, one describing the build-up phase, the other the controlled-utilisation phase. The controlled-utilisation phase of oxygen-independent glycolysis and the build-up of aerobic metabolism are shown to be closely inter-related. The theoretical relations display trends consistent with published experimental results. Some property values are derived, but because of the scatter of the experimental results, the values are, in general, to be regarded as tentative.", "[Anaerobic capacity--theoretical basis and methods for practical testing]. The ATP turnover rate is raised during highly intensive exercise. Part of the ATP used is regenerated anaerobically independently of oxygen consumption. Lactate production accounts for 75% of the anaerobic ATP production, while breakdown of phosphocreatine accounts for the remaining 25%. Anaerobic processes can provide energy for about one minute's exercise during exhausting exercise lasting several minutes. An athlete may improve his anaerobic capacity by 10% during two months of proper training, and the measured improvement is of significance for athletes. The accumulated oxygen deficit has been introduced to quantify the anaerobic release of energy during exercise. The method is discussed briefly.", "other more highly-oxidized electron acceptors). A consequence is that the production of ATP by fermentation is less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation, where pyruvate is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide. Fermentation produces 4 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose compared to 38 by aerobic respiration: 8 are produced from FADH2, and 30 are produced from NADH, for a total of 38. Since 2 ATP molecules are used in glycolysis, the net yield for fermentation is 2 ATP versus 36 ATP from aerobic respiration. Aerobic glycolysis is a method employed by muscle cells for the production of lower-intensity energy over a longer period of time when oxygen is plentiful. Under low-oxygen conditions, however, vertebrates use the less-efficient but faster anaerobic glycolysis to produce ATP.

By feeding creatine analogs to rodents, it is possible to test whether these synthetic analogs and the endogenous substrates obey simple rules of enzyme kinetics and equilibration. Two important concepts can be tested: (1) Are phosphorus metabolises fully visible to in vivo 31P-NMR measurements? (2) Does CK equilibrate with its substrates in the cytosol? It will be shown that in spite of localized enzymatic activity and microcompartments in the cell (such as mitochondria), creatine kinase equilibrates with its substrates in fast and slow skeletal muscles at rest. Therefore, the physicochemical properties of the cytosol are best described as freely mixing with respect to the bioenergetically important metabolites", "The presence of this energy buffer system keeps the ATP/ADP ratio high at subcellular places where ATP is needed, which ensures that the free energy of ATP remains high and minimizes the loss of adenosine nucleotides, which would cause cellular dysfunction. Such high-energy phosphate buffers in the form of phosphocreatine or phosphoarginine are known as phosphagens. In addition, due to the presence of subcompartmentalized Creatine Kinase Isoforms at specific sites of the cell, the phosphocreatine/creatine kinase system also acts as an intracellular energy transport system from those places where ATP is generated (mitochondria and glycolysis) to those places where energy is needed and used, e.g. at the myofibrils for muscle contraction, at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) for calcium pumping and many more biological processes which depend on ATP.", "is taken up by the mitochondria via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU).[] Within the mitochondria, calcium plays a role in determining the rate of substrate use in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which is coupled to the rate of oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain (because the TCA cycle provides reducing equivalents). As a result, calcium cycling is fine-tuned to the rate of ATP production. In the cell, ATP is converted to phosphocreatine which is shuttled in the subcellular space through creatinine kinase isoforms to regions of high energy demand, being the myofilaments for shortening or the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase pump for calcium buffering. In this way, excitation coupling is fine-tuned to energy metabolism, forming a streamlined and efficient engine ().", "Energetic Interactions Between Subcellular Organelles in Striated Muscles. Adult striated muscle cells present highly organized structure with densely packed intracellular organelles and a very sparse cytosol accounting for only few percent of cell volume. These cells have a high and fluctuating energy demand that, in continuously working oxidative muscles, is fulfilled mainly by oxidative metabolism. ATP produced by mitochondria should be directed to the main energy consumers, ATPases of the excitation-contraction system; at the same time, ADP near ATPases should rapidly be eliminated. This is achieved by phosphotransfer kinases, the most important being creatine kinase (CK). Specific CK isoenzymes are located in mitochondria and in close proximity to ATPases, forming efficient energy shuttle between these structures. In addition to phosphotransfer kinases, ATP/ADP can be directly channeled between mitochondria", "approach has served biology well and continues to be useful. Here, we consider the diffusion of small and large molecules in muscles and energy metabolism in the context of intracellular space. We find that in attempting to explain certain phenomena, a purely kinetic paradigm appears insufficient. Instead, phenomena such as the 'shuttling' of high-energy phosphate donors and acceptors and the binding of metabolic enzymes to intracellular structures or to each other are better understood when metabolic rates and their regulation are considered in the context of intracellular compartments, distances, gradients and diffusion. As in all of biology, however, complexity dominates, and to such a degree that one pathway may consist of several reactions that each behave according to different rules. 'Soluble' creatine kinase operates at or near equilibrium,", "Compartmentation of ATP synthesis and utilization in smooth muscle: roles of aerobic glycolysis and creatine kinase. The phosphocreatine content of smooth muscle is of similar magnitude to ATP. Thus the function of the creatine kinase system in this tissue cannot simply be regarded as an energy buffer. Thus an understanding of its role in smooth muscle behavior can point to CK function in other systems. From our perspective CK function in smooth muscle is one example of a more general phenomenon, that of the co-localization of ATP synthesis and utilization. In an interesting and analogous fashion distinct glycolytic cascades are also localized in regions of the cell with specialized energy requirements. Similar to CK, glycolytic enzymes are known to be localized on thin filaments, sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma", "The subcellular compartmentation of creatine kinase isozymes as a precondition for a proposed phosphoryl-creatine circuit. The idea of a PCr-circuit is supported by the fact that in fully differentiated and highly specialized cells with high sudden energy turnover, e.g., skeletal and cardiac muscle [Wallimann and Eppenberger, 1985], brain and retina photoreceptor cells [Wallimann et al, 1986a], spermatozoa [Tombes and Shapiro, 1985; Wallimann et al, 1986b] and Torpedo electrocytes [Wallimann et al, 1985] mitochondrial CK is generally found in conjunction with cytosolic CK's with a significant fraction of the latter being associated subcellularly in a compartmented fashion at intracellular sites of high energy turnover.

The process of energy transfer between mitochondria and ATPases has been a subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies. As a part of a larger energy transfer system, creatine kinase and adenylate kinase shuttles are suggested to play an important role in heart and brain. Because of the shuttles, mitochondria deliver energy to ATPases in the form of phosphocreatine (PCr) and ATP, where highly diffusive PCr provides a temporal and spacial energy buffer. Importance of the shuttles is expected to be large in cells that contain a highly compartmentalized environment with restricted diffusion of metabolites, such as heart muscle cells.

This pool, however, is continually replenished during contraction, as described later, so that even when the muscle fatigues, ATP stores are only modestly decreased. Muscle cells contain creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.
