Robertsonian translocations occur when an entire long arm of an acrocentric chromosome is translocated onto the short arm of another acrocentric chromosome. Balanced carriers of a Robertsonian translocation contain only 45 chromosomes, with one chromosome consisting of two long arms of an acrocentric chromosome.

Females can be more frequently affected than males since they have two X chromosomes that could potentially carry the abnormal gene, whereas a male has only one. However, the Lyon hypothesis states that X-inactivation renders only one copy of the X chromosome active in each cell hence on average one would expect only one half of the cells to express the abnormal gene. The chance of passing on an X-linked dominant disorder differs between men and women. As a disease inheritance pattern, it is less common than X-linked recessive. # Inheritance Females usually have two X chromosomes, while most males have one X and one Y chromosome. If", "carry a mutation for these syndromes and would be at risk for developing certain types of cancers. A known family history or personal history of a genetic disorder or chromosomal abnormality might prompt testing in anticipation of pregnancy planning. A pedigree usually is drawn to help visualize various inheritance patterns. Answers to questions about the family help determine if there is an autosomal dominant, AR, X-linked, or sporadic disorder. When a child is affected with the new onset of an AD disorder, it is necessary to closely examine the parents to check for the presence of manifestations. If the parents are unaffected, the child\u2019s condition is most likely the result of a new mutation; the risk of recurrence is extremely low (although not 0, because of the possibility", "apply. Transferred to our context, a good and comprehensive argument against a particular inheritance might look like this: The trait at hand cannot be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (claim), because a couple without the trait has an affected child (evidence). This rules out autosomal dominant inheritance, because at least one parent would also have to be an allele carrier for the child to inherit a dominant allele. However, this parent would also have to be affected, because this dominant allele would have led to the expression of the corresponding phenotype (warrant or reasoning). As a result, to formulate a complete explanation to a pedigree problem, students must formulate conclusive arguments against three of the four relevant modes of inheritance based on content knowledge and evidence available", "display three Mendelian modes of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked. About 65% of human monogenic disorders are autosomal dominant, 25% are autosomal recessive, and 5% are X-linked. Genetic testing is now available for many of these disorders and plays an increasingly important role in clinical medicine (Chap. 84). autosomal Dominant DisorDers These disorders assume particular relevance because mutations in a single allele are sufficient to cause the disease. In contrast to recessive disorders, in which disease pathogenesis is relatively straightforward because there is loss of gene function, dominant disorders can be caused by various disease mechanisms, many of which are unique to the function of the genetic pathway involved. In autosomal dominant disorders, individuals are affected in successive generations; the disease does not occur in the", "The pattern of inheritance of X-linked traits is not dominant or recessive, just X-linked. UNLABELLED: Our modern concepts of genetic inheritance originated nearly a century ago. Early concepts of dominant and recessive inheritance were developed in insects and were subsequently applied to sex-linked inheritance in mammals. Years of clinical experience, however, suggest that the modern-day rules for X-linked dominant and recessive diseases do not explain why so many female carriers of X-linked 'recessive' disorders have an abnormal phenotype. In a review of 32 X-linked diseases we revealed an unexpectedly high degree of intermediate disease penetrance in females that cannot be explained by existing concepts. We recommend that the terms 'dominant' and recessive' be abandoned and that these disorders be referred to as X-linked. In this review we will", "condition appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of a genetic change in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In other families, the condition has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of a gene are altered in each cell. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. # Diagnosis Although confirmation of a specific genetic marker is in a significant number of individuals, there are no tests to clearly determine if this is what a person has. The Syndrome is usually caused by an mUPD on chromosome 7, in 7%", "women. As a disease inheritance pattern, it is less common than X-linked recessive. # Inheritance Females usually have two X chromosomes, while most males have one X and one Y chromosome. If a child has inherited the mutation from the X chromosome of one of their parents they will have the condition. A woman with an X-linked dominant disorder has a 50% chance of having an affected daughter or son with each pregnancy. The sons of a man with an X-linked dominant disorder will not be affected (since they inherit their only X chromosome from their mother), but his daughters will all inherit the condition. - A woman with an X-linked dominant disorder has a 50% chance of having an affected child. - The daughters of a man", "dominant inheritance). Of the advanced genetics students, 56.1% correctly selected the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, a correct decision in the multiple-choice item does not necessarily indicate that the decision is explained based on correct arguments. It can be stated that, in most cases, students chose the correct mode of inheritance if at least one of their arguments was found to be conclusive (see Figure 4). Even students who had not formulated any conclusive arguments in a pedigree problem sometimes identified the correct inheritance. The proportion is even quite large in the case of autosomal recessive inheritance, especially among advanced genetics students (see Figure 4). For an in-depth analysis of which arguments were rated as correct in which group, see Supplemental Figure 1.", "or mendelian disorder is caused by a mutation or alteration in a single locus or gene in one or both members of a gene pair.

By age 25, approximately 0.4 percent of the population exhibits an abnormality attributed to a monogenic disorder, and 2 percent will have at least one such disorder during their lifetime (Table 13-3).

Further developments in newborn screening will increase this number further. There are two main arguments put forward to support the developments of an expanded newborn screening programme. Firstly there may be an improvement in patient outcome. The early detection of disorders either in the pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic phase should, with treatment, result in the prevention of severe illness. This is evident for phenylketonuria and generally accepted for homocystinuria and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, disorders which have a long pre-symptomatic phase.

Hemoglobin must have the correct structure and be trimmed in such a way that the number of \u03b1-chains precisely matches that of the \u03b2-chains. In adulthood, hemoglobin consists of approximately 98% HbA (\u03b12\u03b22), less than 3% HbA2 (\u03b12\u03b42), and traces of HbF (\u03b12\u03b32). The term \u201cthalassemia\u201d refers to hemoglobinopathies characterized by partly or completely suppressed synthesis of one of the two types of polypeptide chains (\u03b1 or \u03b2) as a result of missense/nonsense mutations (single-base substitutions) or frameshift mutations of the genes controlling the structure of the hemoglobin-protein chains in one or both \u201callelic\u201d globin genes, providing decreased hemoglobin concentration, microcytosis, and anemia.

HbA accounts for over 90% of the hemoglobin in a normal adult. If HbA1c is included, the percentage rises to ~97%. Because 2,3bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) reduces the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, the weaker interaction between 2,3-BPG and HbF results in a higher oxygen affinity for HbF relative to HbA. HbF consists of \u03b12\u03b32. HbA1c is a glycated form of HbA, formed nonenzymically in red blood cells.

In a review of 40 European studies selected for similarities in diagnostic and ascertainment procedures, Gottesman showed the following approximate lifetime risks for schizophrenia to relatives of schizophrenic patients: parents, 6.0%; siblings, 9.0%; offspring (of one parent with schizophrenia), 13.0%; and offspring of two schizophrenic parents, 46.0% . Risks to second-degree relatives ranged from 6.0% for half-siblings to 2.0% for uncles and aunts, while the risk for first cousins, a type of thirddegree relative, was approximately 2.0% . Modern family studies, using narrower diagnostic criteria than those employed in earlier European studies, have essentially confirmed both the pattern of risk in families, and the approximate rates at which they occur.\n", "of abortions, stillbirths, miscarriages, and early death.

Family histories may be imprecise because of various possible reasons: - Adoption or illegitimacy - Lack of contact between close relatives - Uncertainty about the relative's exact diagnosis In complex situations, a family tree may be necessary to cover the necessary aspects. # How will a doctor use my family history to benefit my health?

The results also show that there is a disparity between the attitudes of well family members and patients: 92 percent of parents compared to 25 percent of patients identified schizophrenia as a disorder associated with extreme burden. Regarding childbearing decisions, 29 percent of parents compared to 66 percent of patients say they would have children (in hindsight or in future) based on what they now know about schizophrenia in their family. This result corroborates reports from genetic counselors for other illnesses: the wish for children appears to override considerations of risk and burden for those potentially genetically affected persons who have not reached their desired family size.", "(father/mother, uncle/aunt, son/daughter). We tested the anticipation effect according to previously published methodologies, such as percentages of parent-child pairs showing negative versus positive anticipation, comparison of anticipation limited to parent-child or uncle-nephew pairs, anticipation analysis on the basis of families with unilineal origins only, and comparison of the age at onset-survival distribution of the two generations.

Reasons for selecting a particular curative treatment were variable, but the most selected reasons were perception of a cure (N=4) or decreased severity (N=4), and not needing a donor (N=4).

Direct diagnosis of sickle cell anemia using RFLP: The genetic disorders of Hb are the most common genetic diseases in humans. In the case of sickle cell anemia (Fig. 34.17), the point mutation that gives rise to the disease (see p. 35) is actually one and the same mutation that gives rise to the polymorphism. However, direct detection by RFLP of diseases that result from point mutations is limited to only a few genetic diseases. a. Early diagnostic efforts: In the past, prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell anemia involved the determination of the amount and kinds of Hb synthesized in the nucleated red cells obtained from fetal blood. However, the invasive procedures to obtain fetal blood have a high mortality rate (~5%),", "result from the substitution of a single nucleotide base by a different base, resulting in the replacement of one amino acid by another in the protein product. The mutation in the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin giving rise to sickle cell anemia is an excellent example of a point mutation that alters the meaning of the genetic code. Such mutations are sometimes called missense mutations. By contrast, certain point mutations may change an amino acid codon to a chain termination codon, or a stop codon. Such \u201cnonsense\u201d mutations interrupt translation, and in most cases RNAs are rapidly degraded, a phenomenon called nonsense mediated decay, such that little or no protein is formed. Frameshift mutations occur when the insertion or deletion of one or two base pairs alters the reading", "in DNA Severity of damage: silent << missense < nonsense < frameshift.

Single nucleotide substitutions Silent mutation Nucleotide substitution codes for same (synonymous) amino acid; often base change in 3rd position of codon (tRNA wobble). Missense mutation Nucleotide substitution results in changed amino acid (called conservative if new amino acid has similar chemical structure).

The only pitfalls of using sequencing as a routine diagnostic technique are the cost and the time of analysis, which is increased compared with standard PCR assays.

New genes developing in each of the populations don't get reduced to half when one side replaces the other, they mix and form a population with the advantages of both sides. - Sometimes, a mutation (e. g.

Triploidy, usually due to polyspermy, occurs in about 2-3% of all human pregnancies and ~15% of miscarriages. The vast majority of triploid conceptions end as miscarriage and those that do survive to term typically die shortly after birth. In some cases survival past birth may occur longer if there is mixoploidy with both a diploid and a triploid cell population present.

The hypothesis of a tendency toward non-disjunction is pushing for an prenatal diagnosis for patients with X mosaicism. However one can question about the real meaning of this abnormality regarding to the fact that the patients referred are not representative of the general population.

Chromosomal sex, defined by a karyotype, describes the X and/or Y chromosome complement (46,XY; 46,XX) that is established at the time of fertilization. The presence of a normal Y chromosome determines that testis development will occur even in the presence of multiple X chromosomes (e.g., 47,XXY or 48,XXXY). The loss of an X chromosome impairs gonad development (45,X or 45,X/46,XY mosaicism). Fetuses with no X chromosome (45,Y) are not viable. Gonadal sex refers to the histologic and functional characteristics of gonadal tissue as testis or ovary. The embryonic gonad is bipotential and can develop (from ~42 days after conception) into either a testis or an ovary, depending on which genes are expressed (Fig. 410-2).

Actual karyotype of this patient was 45,X[95]/47,XXX[5], which means that the proportion of 47,XXX cells was very small. One advantage of utilizing FISH to identify low\u2010level mosaicism is that it is of great importance to determine whether mosaicism containing Y fragment is present.

The choice of which X chromosome will be inactivated is random in placental mammals such as mice and humans, but once an X chromosome is inactivated it will remain inactive throughout the lifetime of the cell. Unlike the random X-inactivation in placental mammals, inactivation in marsupials applies exclusively to the paternally derived X chromosome. # History", "but deleterious overexpression in females. In response, selection is proposed to favor inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in females, restoring optimal gene expression. Here, we make a first attempt at shedding light on this intricate process from a population genetic perspective, elucidating the sexually antagonistic selective forces involved. We derive conditions for the process to work and analyze evolutionary stability of the system. The implications of our results are discussed in the light of empirical findings and a recently proposed alternative hypothesis for the evolution of X-inactivation.", "Gene Survival and Death on the Human Y Chromosome. So far, we have discussed factors that could influence whether an X-linked gene\u2019s Y gametolog is retained over evolutionary time. A different perspective is to consider how gene loss on the Y might affect evolution of the X. Specifically, X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals is hypothesized to have evolved as a mechanism to achieve equal dosage of sex-linked genes between males and females, in response to the loss of expression and function of Y-linked gametologs in males (;;;. Thus, the proposed ancestral state, before the Y degenerated, is expression of all X-linked genes from both X chromosomes (fig. 2). For X-linked genes without functional Y homologs, the likely derived state is therefore inactivation of one copy in", "female germline, so that all ova contain an active X chromosome. ## Selection of active X chromosomes Normal females possess two X chromosomes, and in any given cell one chromosome will be active (designated as Xa) and one will be inactive (Xi). However, studies of individuals with extra copies of the X chromosome show that in cells with more than two X chromosomes there is still only one Xa, and all the remaining X chromosomes are inactivated. This indicates that the default state of the X chromosome in females is inactivation, but one X chromosome is always selected to remain active. It is hypothesized that there is an autosomally-encoded 'blocking factor' which binds to the X chromosome and prevents its inactivation. The model postulates that there is limiting", "contains more than a thousand genes, whereas the Y chromosome is small and contains less than 100 genes. Mammals have evolved a dosage compensation mechanism to equalize the dosage of X-chromosome gene products between males and females. The correct ratio of X chromosome to auto-some (non-sex chromosome) gene products is carefully controlled, and mutations that interfere with this dosage compensation are generally lethal. Mammals achieve dosage compensation by the transcriptional inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in female somatic cells, a process known as X-inactivation. As a result of X-inactivation, two X chromosomes can coexist within the same nucleus, exposed to the same diffusible transcription regulators, yet differ entirely in their expression. Early in the development of a female embryo, when it consists of a few", "chromosome carries hundreds of genes but few, if any, of these have anything to do directly with sex determination. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in nearly all somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). This phenomenon is called X-inactivation or Lyonization, and creates a Barr body. If X-inactivation in the somatic cell meant a complete de-functionalizing of one of the X-chromosomes, it would ensure that females, like males, had only one functional copy of the X chromosome in each somatic cell. This was previously assumed to be the case. However, recent research suggests that the Barr body may be more biologically active than was previously supposed. ## Genes ## Number of genes The following", "red pigment in the fly eye (Figure 4\u201332). It shares features with the extensive spread of heterochromatin that inactivates one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals. There too, a random process acts in each cell of the early embryo to dictate which X chromosome will be inactivated, and that same X chromosome then remains inactive in all the cell\u2019s progeny, creating a mosaic of different clones of cells in the adult body (see Figure 7\u201350). These observations, taken together, point to a fundamental strategy of heterochromatin formation: heterochromatin begets more heterochromatin. This positive feedback can operate both in space, causing the heterochromatic state to spread along the chromosome, and in time, across cell generations, propagating the heterochromatic state of the parent cell to its daughters. The", "coexist within the same nucleus, exposed to the same diffusible transcription regulators, yet differ entirely in their expression. Early in the development of a female embryo, when it consists of a few hundred cells, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell becomes highly condensed into a type of heterochromatin. The initial choice of which X chromosome to inactivate, the maternally inherited one (Xm) or the paternally inherited one (Xp), is random. Once either Xp or Xm has been inactivated, it remains silent throughout all subsequent cell divisions of that cell and its progeny, indicating that the inactive state is faithfully maintained through many cycles of DNA replication and mitosis.

However, there is at least one population in which G6PD deficiency has not been found, namely the indigenous (Amerindian) population of America. Approximately 400 variants have been described. Despite the clinical burden imposed by this enzymopathy, polymorphic frequencies have been reached in many populations.

Since the 1980s the genetic cause of many hereditary tumor syndromes has been elucidated. As a consequence, carriers of a deleterious mutation in these genes may opt for prenatal diagnoses (PND). We studied the uptake of prenatal diagnosis for five hereditary cancer syndromes in the Netherlands. Uptake for retinoblastoma (Rb) was compared with uptake for Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and hereditary breast ovarian cancer (HBOC). A questionnaire was completed by all nine DNA-diagnostic laboratories assessing the number of independent mutation-positive families identified from the start of diagnostic testing until May 2013, and the number of PNDs performed for these syndromes within these families.

The Modern Evolutionary Synthesis (MS) forged in the mid-twentieth century was built on a notion of heredity that excluded soft inheritance, the inheritance of the effects of developmental modifications. However, the discovery of molecular mechanisms that generate random and developmentally induced epigenetic variations is leading to a broadening of the notion of biological heredity that has consequences for ideas about evolution. After presenting some old challenges to the MS that were raised, among others, by Karl Popper, I discuss recent research on epigenetic inheritance, which provides experimental and theoretical support for these challenges. There is now good evidence that epigenetic inheritance is ubiquitous and is involved in adaptive evolution and macroevolution. I argue that the many evolutionary consequences of epigenetic inheritance open", "Inherited Representations are Read in Development. Crucially, this framework only applies if DNA really does have the evolutionary function of transmitting phenotypes down the generations. That substantial but plausible empirical commitment is argued for elsewhere. Bergstrom and Rosvall think it is obvious from its structure that DNA has been adapted for transmitting information. However, the DNA-based inheritance system may instead have arisen by chance, just happening to be particularly good at being an inheritance system. Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry point to lines of evidence that it was the result of selection for its superior information-transmission qualities, but our framework does not depend upon these necessarily uncertain inferences about the origin of DNA, since there is a stronger source of evidence about function, in the way the mechanism has", "\u201credundant\u201d map from genotype and epigenotype to phenotype which strengthens competition between genetic and epigenetic loci. In this scenario (described in Supporting Information S3), each genetic locus is paired with and redundant to one epigenetic marker. This assumption means that perfect adaptation can be achieved entirely by changes at epialleles. The rapid increase in fitness achieved by induced epialleles subsequently relaxes selection on genetic alleles, thereby slowing the rate of fixation of beneficial genetic alleles. Because we measure speciation only at genetic loci, epigenetic interference with genetic evolution can slow down speciation, as defined here, both under hard (Fig. 5) and soft (Fig. S8) selection. Similarly, when migration occurs before epigenetic induction (instead of after, as above), adaptively biased epigenetic induction can slow speciation even under an \u201cadditive\u201d", "Inherited Representations are Read in Development.

In a wider context, soft inheritance is of use when examining the evolution of cultures and ideas, and is related to the theory of Memetics.

In a systematic approach, all modes of inheritance are tested to determine whether they can explain the trait\u2019s distribution.

Transferred to our context, a good and comprehensive argument against a particular inheritance might look like this: The trait at hand cannot be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (claim), because a couple without the trait has an affected child (evidence). This rules out autosomal dominant inheritance, because at least one parent would also have to be an allele carrier for the child to inherit a dominant allele. However, this parent would also have to be affected, because this dominant allele would have led to the expression of the corresponding phenotype (warrant or reasoning).

If a population is brought together with males and females with different allele frequencies, the allele frequency of the male population follows that of the female population because each receives its X chromosome from its mother.

A major barrier to closed system cultivation is the high running cost, which necessitates the use of high-margin crops for economic viability. High-value crops include those with enhanced nutritional value or containing additional functional components for pharmaceutical production or with the aim of providing health benefits. In addition, it is important to develop cultivars equipped with growth parameters that are suitable for closed cultivation.

Many domesticated plants can mate and hybridise with wild relatives when they are grown in proximity, and whatever genes the cultivated plant had can then be passed to the hybrid.

Restriction sites A DNA sequence that is recognized and cut by a restriction enzyme is called a restriction site. Restriction endonucleases cleave dsDNA into fragments of different sizes depending upon the size of the sequence recognized. For example, an enzyme that recognizes a specific 4-bp sequence produces many cuts in the DNA molecule, one every 44 bp. In contrast, an enzyme requiring a unique sequence of 6 bp produces fewer cuts (one every 46 bp) and, therefore, longer pieces. Hundreds of these enzymes, each having different cleavage specificities (varying in both nucleotide sequences and length of recognition sites), are commercially available. III. DNA CLONING Introduction of a foreign DNA", "gene in a mammalian genome would still be only one among a hundred thousand or more DNA fragments, indistinguishable in their average size. How could such a gene be separated from all the others? Because all DNA molecules consist of an approximately equal mixture of the same four nucleotides, they cannot be readily separated, as proteins can, on the basis of their different charges and biochemical properties. The solution to this problem began to emerge with the discovery of restriction nucleases. These enzymes, which are purified from bacteria, cut the DNA double helix at specific sites defined by the local nucleotide sequence, thereby cleaving a long, double-stranded DNA molecule into fragments of strictly defined sizes. Like many of the tools of recombinant DNA technology, restriction nucleases were discovered", "enzyme used, the chances are good that the gene of interest contains more than one restriction site recognized by that enzyme. If this is the case, and if the digestion is allowed to go to completion, the gene of interest is fragmented (that is, it is not contained in any one clone in the library). To avoid this usually undesirable result, a partial digestion is performed in which either the amount or the time of action of the enzyme is limited. This results in cleavage occurring at only a fraction of the restriction sites on any one DNA molecule, thus producing fragments of ~20 kb. Enzymes that cut very frequently (that is, those that recognize 4-bp sequences) are generally used for this purpose so that the result is", "MLGA\u2014a rapid and cost-efficient assay for gene copy-number analysis. We expect to be able to develop better design criteria to improve success as more assays are developed and can be evaluated. Since selected fragments are in the order of 100 bp and CNVs are often in the order of several kilobases, positional constraints on design are quite low. There are, on average, four selectable restriction fragments to choose among per kilobase of genomic DNA sequence, since we are using restriction enzymes with 4 bp recognition sequences. It is possible to further increase freedom of design by introducing a site-specific cleavage of the target strand, making the design only depending on a restriction recognition site at the 3\u2032 end of the target fragment.

Thus for a given sample of DNA (which contains many identical molecules), a particular restriction nuclease will reliably generate the same set of DNA fragments. The size of the resulting fragments depends on the length of the target sequences of the restriction nucleases. As shown in Figure 8\u201324, the enzyme HaeIII cuts at a sequence of four nucleotide pairs; a sequence this long would be expected to occur purely by chance approximately once every 256 nucleotide pairs (1 in 44). In comparison, a restriction nuclease with a target sequence that is eight nucleotides long would be expected to cleave DNA on average once every 65,536 nucleotide pairs", "genomic DNA is the immense size of the molecules involved. The discovery of a special group of bacterial enzymes, called restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes), which cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into smaller, more manageable fragments, opened the way for DNA analysis. Because each enzyme cleaves dsDNA at a specific nucleotide sequence (restriction site), restriction enzymes are used experimentally to obtain precisely defined DNA segments called restriction fragments. A. Specificity Restriction endonucleases recognize short stretches of dsDNA (4\u20138 bp) that contain specific nucleotide sequences. These sequences, which differ for each restriction enzyme, are palindromes, that is, they exhibit twofold rotational symmetry (Fig. 34.2). This means that, within a short region of the dsDNA, the nucleotide sequence on the two strands is identical if each is read in the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction.", "nucleotide pairs (1 in 44). In comparison, a restriction nuclease with a target sequence that is eight nucleotides long would be expected to cleave DNA on average once every 65,536 nucleotide pairs (1 in 48).

Although there is much we do not understand about this mechanism, it indicates the extreme versatility of transcriptional regulation strategies. Transcription regulators switch the transcription of individual genes on and off in cells.

The process of adding nucleotides to the RNA strand is known as elongation; In eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleosides (the full length of the dystrophin gene).

However, after meiosis I, although the cell contains 46 chromosomes it is only considered N because later in anaphase I the sister chromatids will remain together as the spindle pulls the pair toward the pole of the new cell.

In nondisjunction questions, students who consistently answered incorrectly (000 group) had a diversity of misunderstandings about meiosis, with three errors being most common. The nondisjunction questions explicitly asked students to specify a phase in meiosis, if any, that was affected. However, students often failed to consider in which meiotic division, I or II, an error could occur, or they expressed uncertainty about differentiating between the two phases of meiosis. Students also struggled with identifying when during meiosis homologous versus sister chromatids separate; they sometimes attempted to identify the type of chromosome that was failing to separate or to state when each would normally separate, but they were often incorrect. The third error students made represented a general misunderstanding of meiosis", "The template choice decision in meiosis: is the sister important? Recombination between homologous chromosomes is crucial to ensure their proper segregation during meiosis. This is achieved by regulating the choice of recombination template. In mitotic cells, double-strand break repair with the sister chromatid appears to be preferred, whereas interhomolog recombination is favoured during meiosis. However, in the last year, several studies in yeast have shown the importance of the meiotic recombination between sister chromatids. Although this thinking seems to be new, evidences for sister chromatid exchange during meiosis were obtained more than 50 years ago in non-model organisms. In this mini-review, we comment briefly on the most recent advances in this hot topic and also describe observations which suggest the existence of inter-sister repair during meiotic recombination.

Another BIOL 121 instructor used the same subset of eight questions to identify frequent misconceptions, such as those related to the concept of ploidy (Figure 3a, Pre). Knowing that students who answer option (a + b) in question 4 think that the absence of sister chromatids identifies haploid cells (see question 4 in the Supplemental Material), the instructor prioritized and specifically targeted the issue of what it means for a cell to be haploid or diploid in terms of its chromosomes\u2019 structure. At the end of the unit on genetics, which included meiosis, students took the posttest, and their answers to question 4 revealed that, in spite of the targeted teaching, this misconception related to ploidy was persistent (Figure 3a, Post).

One entire haploid content of chromosomes is contained in each of the resulting daughter cells; the first meiotic division therefore reduces the ploidy of the original cell by a factor of 2. Meiosis II consists of decoupling each chromosome's sister strands (chromatids), and segregating the individual chromatids into haploid daughter cells. The two cells resulting from meiosis I divide during meiosis II, creating 4 haploid daughter cells.

In meiosis II, an equational division similar to mitosis will occur whereby the sister chromatids are finally split, creating a total of 4 haploid cells (23 chromosomes, N) per daughter cell from the first division. ### Prophase I Homologous chromosomes pair (or synapse) and crossing over (or recombination) occurs - a step unique to meiosis. The paired and replicated chromosomes are called bivalents or tetrads, which have two chromosomes and four chromatids, with one chromosome coming from each parent. At this stage, non-sister chromatids may cross-over at points called chiasmata (plural; singular chiasma). The first stage of prophase I is the leptotene stage, also known as leptonema, from Greek words meaning \"thin threads\". During this stage, individual chromosomes begin to condense", "cells enter G2 and progress through a second checkpoint before entering mitosis. At this stage, the chromosomes condense and are aligned along the equatorial plate at metaphase. The two identical sister chromatids, held together at the centromere, divide and migrate to opposite poles of the cell. After formation of a nuclear membrane around the two separated sets of chromatids, the cell divides and two daughter cells are formed, thus restoring the diploid (2n) state. Assortment and Segregation of Genes During Meiosis Meiosis occurs only in germ cells of the gonads. It shares certain features with mitosis but involves two distinct steps of cell division that reduce the chromosome number to the haploid state. In addition, there is active recombination that generates genetic diversity. During the first cell division,", "plants. Like their mitotic counterparts, duplicated meiotic prophase chromosomes first appear as long threadlike structures, in which the sister chromatids are so tightly glued together that they appear as one. It is during early prophase I that the homologs begin to associate along their length in a process called pairing, which, in some organisms at least, begins with interactions between complementary DNA sequences (called pairing sites) in the two homologs. As prophase progresses, the homologs become more closely juxtaposed, forming a four-chromatid structure called a bivalent (Figure 17\u201354A). In most species, homolog pairs are then locked together by homologous recombination: DNA double-strand breaks are formed at several locations in each sister chromatid, resulting in large numbers of DNA recombination events between the homologs (as described in Chapter 5)."]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_medicalgenetics", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

The answer to this question depends on the functional consequences of the mutation. If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

These are explained in the following sections. # Trisomy 21 Trisomy 21 (47,XX,+21) is caused by a meiotic nondisjunction event. A normal gamete (either egg or sperm) has one copy of each chromosome (23", "chromosomes-48Yor with both additional X and Y chromosomes-48,YYor 49,XYY-are more likely to have congenital abnormalities, medical problems, and intellectual disability (Tartaglia, 2011). \u2022 Abnormalities of Chromosome Structure Structural chromosomal abnormalities include deletions, duplications, translocations, isochromosomes, inversions, ring chromosomes, and mosaicism (see Table 13-1). heir overall birth prevalence approximates 0.3 percent (Nussbaum, 2007). Identiication of a structural chromosomal abnormality raises two primary questions. First, what phenotypic abnormalities or later developmental abnormalities are associated with this finding? Second, is evaluation of parental karyotype indicated-speciically, are the parents at increased risk of carrying this abnormality? If so, what is their risk of having future afected ofspring? A chromosomal deletion indicates that a portion of a chromosome is missing, whereas a duplication means that a portion has been included twice.

Painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid number of man was 46 or 48, at first favoring 46. He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on man having an XX/XY system. Considering their techniques, these results were quite remarkable.

Today it is recognized that there is no ideal vector system, and that while Ad vectors are not suitable for all applications, the significant advantages over other vector systems including efficient transduction of a variety of cell types, both quiescent and dividing, make it optimal for certain applications. These include protocols where high levels of short-term expression", "its ends via the ITR (inverted terminal repeats) recombination to form circular, episomal forms which are predicted to be the primary cause of the long term gene expression. There are a few disadvantages to using AAV, including the small amount of DNA it can carry (low capacity) and the difficulty in producing it. This type of virus is being used, however, because it is non-pathogenic (most people carry this harmless virus). In contrast to adenoviruses, most people treated with AAV will not build an immune response to remove the virus and the cells that have been successfully treated with it. Several trials with AAV are on-going or in preparation, mainly trying to treat muscle and eye diseases; the two tissues where the virus seems particularly useful. However, clinical", "one of the best viral vector candidate for human gene therapy approaches, as they have a high transduction efficiency, can be produced at high titer, and very rarely integrate into the host genome, thus reducing the risk of insertional mutagenesis.

Therefore, although their current limitations, Ad vectors represent one of the most efficient tools for in vivo gene delivery and hold promise for clinical applications requiring a transient transgene expression.", "Novel lentiviral vectors with mutated reverse transcriptase for mRNA delivery of TALE nucleases. Importantly, short-term expression of designer nucleases in the target cells might not only be sufficient, but even desirable to ensure specificity. Vice versa, excessively high-level as well as prolonged expression of nucleases might result in increased off-target activity but also re-mutation of the targeted locus. These preconditions may limit the use of DNA-based systems such as adenoviral and adeno-associated vectors or plasmids, since they transiently provide very high protein levels. Moreover, expression mediated by such vectors is relatively stable in non-dividing cells, and there is a finite risk of undesired transgene integration into the host genome, potentially mediating long-term expression. To address these limitations we aimed to develop a delivery system that combines the benefits", "the notable exception of immunocompromised patients, for which it can be life-threatening. To promote safety of recombinant adenoviruses used in laboratories, the E1 region of the adenoviral genome is typically deleted, rendering the virus replication incompetent and creating a location for insertion of transgene cassettes []. Recombinant adenoviruses typically have broad tropism, high efficiency of gene delivery, and ability to transduce both dividing and quiescent cell populations. Upon entry into the nucleus, adenovirus can initiate gene transcription without integrating into the host genome, circumventing problematic insertional mutagenesis.

The most efficient vehicles for delivery of foreign genes to the target tissues are modified adenoviruses. Adenoviral vectors of the first generation, despite the high infection efficacy, have an essential drawback: they induce strong immune response, which leads to short term expression of the transgene, and limits their usefulness in clinical trials. In contrast, helper-dependent adenoviral vectors (HdAd) lacking all viral coding sequences display only minimal immunogenicity and negligible side-effects, allowing for long-term transgene expression. Thus, HdAd vehicles have become the carrier of choice for adenoviral", "Selecting a Cell Engineering Methodology During Cell Therapy Product Development. Unlike retroviral and lentiviral vectors, an attractive benefit of adenovirus and AAV is their inability to integrate into the host genome, thus alleviating many of the safety concerns associated with the use of permanent integrating vectors. Human adenovirus does not contain any complementary DNA sequences that result in homologous recombination in human cells and thus expression is transient and not long lasting. Because of this, adenovirus has become a promising vector for vaccines and oncolytic viral therapy, where the replicating mechanism of action of adenovirus is combined with the expression of potent cytokines from the same vector.

Moreover recent findings suggest that this process also has the capability to produce an additional set of RNA products that differ from typical mRNA molecules.

For example, we have seen that acquisition of cap-binding complexes, exon junction complexes, and poly-A-binding proteins mark the completion of capping, splicing, and poly-A addition, respectively. A properly completed mRNA molecule is also distinguished by the proteins it lacks. For example, the presence of an snRNP protein would signify incomplete or aberrant splicing.

These processes occur in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes. - Capping changes the five prime end of the mRNA to a three prime end by 5'-5' linkage, which protects the mRNA from 5' exonuclease, which degrades foreign RNA. The cap also helps in ribosomal binding. - Splicing removes the introns, noncoding regions that are transcribed into RNA, in order to make the mRNA able to create proteins. Cells do this by spliceosome's binding on either side of an intron, looping the intron into a circle and then cleaving it off. The two ends of the exons are then joined together. - Addition of poly(A) tail otherwise", "mRNAs, for example, the 5\u02b9 cap and the poly-A tail are both recognized by the translation-initiation machinery before translation begins (see Figure 6\u201370). The most powerful mRNA surveillance system, called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, eliminates defective mRNAs before they move away from the nucleus. This mechanism is brought into play when the cell determines that an mRNA molecule has a nonsense (stop) codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the \u201cwrong\u201d place. This situation is likely to arise in an mRNA molecule that has been improperly spliced, because aberrant splicing will usually result in the random introduction of a nonsense codon into the reading frame of the mRNA\u2014especially in organisms, such as humans, that have a large average intron size (see Figure 6\u201331B).

Instead, as discussed in Chapter 6, the selection of an AUG codon as a translation start site is largely determined by its proximity to the cap at the 5\u02b9 end of the mRNA molecule, which is the site at which the small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA and begins scanning for an initiating AUG codon. In eukaryotes, translational repressors can bind to the 5\u02b9 end of the mRNA and thereby inhibit translation initiation. Other repressors recognize nucleotide sequences in the 3\u02b9 UTR of specific mRNAs and decrease translation initiation by interfering with the communication between the 5\u02b9 cap and 3\u02b9 poly-A tail, a step required for efficient translation (see Figure 6\u201370). A particularly important type", "Alternative mRNA processing sites decrease genetic variability while increasing functional diversity. While transcription is coupled to translation in prokaryotic cells, transcription is coupled to mRNA processing, packaging and nuclear export in eukaryotic cells (Box). Consequently, co-transcriptional constraints, that trigger RNAPII pausing, impact on several steps of the gene expression process. For example, biophysical constraints at gene 5\u2032-end may play an important role in the complex interplay between RNAPII promoter release, transcription elongation, mRNA capping, and 5\u2032 splice site recognition of the first intron. Indeed, the GC-rich 5\u2032-end of nascent mRNAs can interact with both the complementary DNA strand and with the RNA exit channel of RNAPII, which collectively could contribute to RNAPII pausing, increasing the time window for the recruitment of factors involved in 5\u2032-end RNA processing (Box).", "with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete. RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is", "Cap-dependent and cap-independent translation in eukaryotic systems. Unlike bacterial protein synthesis, eukaryotic protein synthesis has several mechanisms to initiate translation including cap-dependent initiation, re-initiation and internal initiation. While there is extensive biochemical characterization of the multiple steps in cap-dependent initiation, most of the information on the other two mechanisms is derived from studies on the nucleic acid sequences that influence their efficiency. However, even in the best of circumstances, both re-initiation and internal initiation are only 25% as efficient as cap-dependent initiation and more commonly, are only 1-10% as efficient. This general lack of efficiency leaves open possibilities for mis-interpretation/artifacts in vivo (cryptic promoters, alternate splicing) or in vitro (nuclease degradation).

By modularity we mean a genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic effects among characters serving different functions, with pleiotropic effects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single functional complex.

A recessive mutation is one that is no longer able to cause the mutant phenotype in the presence of a single wild-type copy of the gene.

Although this led to a straightforward diagnosis (an embryo was considered either normal or abnormal), it simply avoided the issue and, in hindsight, may have led to numerous misdiagnoses with negative clinical consequences.

In contrast to recessive disorders, in which disease pathogenesis is relatively straightforward because there is loss of gene function, dominant disorders can be caused by various disease mechanisms, many of which are unique to the function of the genetic pathway involved. In autosomal dominant disorders, individuals are affected in successive generations; the disease does not occur in the", "mode of inheritance is autosomal [claim], as both sexes are affected [data]\u201d (Student 1009|Line 40). Therefore, arguments regarding the mode of inheritance represent condition\u2013action pairs, as described by. However, these arguments can also be further classified from a scientific perspective. Arguments regarding the mode of inheritance can represent either clear-cut decisions or indications for or against individual modes of inheritance. For example, in the case of X-linked recessive inheritance, more males tend to be affected than females. If such a distribution is present, this can therefore be an indication of an X-linked recessive inheritance, but it is not suitable as definitive proof. To account for this distinction, we have used two categories: proof and clues.

First, estimates of the model parameters are derived by minimizing chi-square deviations of the observed frequencies of genotypes with alleles (0,1,2...) units apart from their theoretical expected values.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

Another symptom of OTC is a buildup of orotic acid in the blood. This is due to an anaplerism that occurs with carbamoyl phosphate entering", "symptoms more subtle. In patients with partial enzyme deficiencies, the first recognized clinical episode may be delayed for months or years. One in 70000 adults has an ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Levels of urea cycle intermediates may be decreased, as carbamoyl phosphate cannot replenish the cycle. The carbamoyl phosphate instead goes into the uridine monophosphate synthetic pathway. Here, orotic acid (one step of this alternative pathway) levels in the blood are increased. A potential treatment for the high ammonia levels is to give sodium benzoate, which combines with glycine to produce hippurate, at the same time removing an ammonium group. Biotin also plays an important role in the functioning of the OTC enzyme and has been shown to reduce ammonia intoxication in animal experiments.", "Imaging of extrapontine myelinolysis preceding central pontine myelinolysis in a case of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency with hyperammonaemia and hypokalaemia.

Therefore, the conversion of ammonia to urea is severely impaired, leading to elevated levels of ammonia. 2. Congenital: Genetic deficiencies of each of the five enzymes of the urea cycle (and of NAGS) have been described, with an overall incidence of ~1:25,000 live births. X-linked OTC deficiency is the most common of these disorders, predominantly affecting males, although female carriers may become symptomatic. All of the other urea cycle disorders follow an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern. In each case, the failure to synthesize urea leads to hyperammonemia during the first weeks following birth. [Note: The hyperammonemia seen with arginase deficiency is less severe because arginine contains two waste nitrogens and can be", "conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process.

Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most common of these disorders. # Who is at highest risk? Boys are more often affected by ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency than girls.

Genetic association studies of complex traits often rely on standardised quantitative phenotypes, such as percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume and body mass index to measure an underlying trait of interest (eg lung function, obesity). These phenotypes are appealing because they provide an easy mechanism for comparing subjects, although such standardisations may not be the best way to control for confounders and other covariates. We recommend adjusting raw or standardised phenotypes within the study population via regression.

A. Genetic contributions It is now evident that genetic mechanisms play a major role in determining body weight. 1. Biologic origin: The importance of genetics as a determinant of obesity is indicated by the observation that children who are adopted usually show a body weight that correlates with their biologic rather than adoptive parents. Furthermore, identical twins have very similar BMI (Fig. 26.5), whether reared together or apart, and their BMI are more similar than those of nonidentical, dizygotic twins. 2. Mutations: Rare, single gene mutations can cause human obesity.

Cell diversification does not always depend on extracellular signals: in some cases, daughter cells are born different as a result of an asymmetric cell division, in which some important molecule or molecules are distributed unequally between the two daughters. This asymmetric inheritance ensures that the two daughter cells develop differently (Figure 21\u201312). Asymmetric division is a common feature of early development, where the fertilized egg already has an internal pattern and cleavage of this large cell segregates different determinants into separate blastomeres. We shall see that asymmetric division also plays a part in some later developmental processes.

Not all cell diversification arises by cell\u2013cell interactions, however: daughter cells can be born different as a result of asymmetric cell division. Regulators of transcription and chromatin structure bind to regulatory DNA and determine the fate of each cell. Differences of body plan seem to arise to a large extent from differences in the regulatory DNA associated with each gene.

A theory of development would effectively enable one to compute the adult organism from the genetic information in the egg. The problem may be approached by viewing the egg as containing a program for development, and considering the logical nature of the program by treating cells as automata and ignoring the details of molecular mechanisms. It is suggested that development is essentially a simple process, the cells having a limited repertoire of overt activities and interacting with each other by means of simple signals, and that general principles may be discerned. The complexity lies in the specification of the internal state which may be described in terms of a gene-switching network. Pattern formation is a central feature in development; it is the process", "the central question: how are the cells in different positions driven toward their different fates? We have already explained how maternal factors deposited in the developing frog egg define its animal-vegetal axis, and how cortical rotation triggered by fertilization defines the orientation of the dorsoventral axis (see Figure 21\u201314). But how does the establishment of axes lead on to the subdivision of the embryo into the future body parts? The maternal gene products lead to the formation of signaling centers on the vegetal and dorsal sides of the embryo. The dorsal signaling center in particular has a special place in the history of developmental biology. Experiments in the early twentieth century identified it as a small cluster of cells, located on the dorsal side of the amphibian embryo,", "structure can be traced in a similar way to changes in regulatory DNA. For example, these account for a large part of the dramatic difference between the wild teosinte plant and its modern descendant, maize, through some 10,000 years of mutation and selection by Native Americans. Drosophila has been the foremost model organism for the study of the genetics of animal development. Its embryonic pattern is initiated by the products of maternal-effect genes called egg-polarity genes, which operate by setting up graded distributions of transcription regulators in the egg and early embryo. The gradient of Bicoid protein along the A-P axis, for example, helps initiate the orderly expression of gap genes, pair-rule genes, and segment-polarity genes. These three classes of segmentation genes, through a hierarchy of interactions, become", "along the D-V axis. Together with the Bicoid group of genes, and acting in a broadly similar way, their gene products mark out three fundamental partitions of body regions\u2014head versus rear, dorsal versus ventral, and endoderm versus mesoderm and ectoderm\u2014 as well as a fourth partition, no less fundamental to the body plan of animals: the distinction between germ cells and somatic cells (Figure 21\u201317). The egg-polarity genes have a further special feature: they are all maternal-effect genes, in that it is the mother\u2019s genome rather than the zygote\u2019s genome that is critical. For example, a fly whose chromosomes are mutant in both copies of the Bicoid gene but who is born from a mother carrying one normal copy of Bicoid develops perfectly normally, without any defects in", "of morphogen and will express both low- and high-threshold target genes. Distinct cell types emerge as a consequence of the different combinations of target gene expression. In this way, the field of cells is subdivided into different types according to their position relative to the source of the morphogen. This is a general mechanism by which cell type diversity can be generated in animal development. Some of the earliest and best-studied morphogens are transcription factors that diffuse within early Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) embryos. However, most morphogens are secreted proteins that signal between cells. # Fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has an unusual developmental system, in which the first thirteen cell divisions of the embryo occur within a syncytium prior to cellularization. Essentially the embryo remains a single cell", "of the stages emphasized over the other. This is called alternation of generations. Most diploid organisms produce monoploid sex cells that can combine to form a diploid zygote, for example animals are primarily diploid but produce monoploid gametes. During meiosis, germ cell precursors have their number of chromosomes halved by randomly \"choosing\" one homologue, resulting in haploid germ cells (sperm and ovum). # Diploid Diploid (2n) cells have two homologous copies of each chromosome, usually one from the mother and one from the father. The exact number of chromosomes may be one or two different from the 2n number yet the cell may still be classified as diploid (although with aneuploidy). Nearly all mammals are diploid organisms, although all individuals have some small fraction of cells that display", "Haploid selection drives new gene male germline expression. Although the haploid selection is presented as a parsimonious explanation for the observed data, there are empirical and theoretical aspects that must be addressed before assuming this hypothesis. On the developmental aspect, later stages of gametogenesis represent the only haploid cells in an extensive list of diploid organisms. However, selection in female haploid stage is not a prominent candidate to boost new gene evolution. In mammalian egg development, the haploid phase is reduced in space and time because meiosis II is only triggered by sperm fertilization, mostly hampering any role for haploid selection in the evolution of new genes. Likewise, in D. melanogaster oogenesis, haploid selection is mostly out of consideration.
