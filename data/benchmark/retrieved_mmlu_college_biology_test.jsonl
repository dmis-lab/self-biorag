This can either be a 1 or 2 step process. Polymerase chain reaction itself is the process used to amplify specific parts of a DNA molecule, via the temperature-mediated enzyme DNA polymerase. Reverse transcription PCR is not to be confused with real-time polymerase chain reaction which is also marketed as RT-PCR. # Processes In the first step of", "end of every mRNA in the solution, allowing 5'->3' synthesis of complementary DNA by the reverse transcriptase enzyme.cDna can also be prepared from mRNA by using gene specific primer or random hexamer primers. After the reverse transcriptase reaction is complete, and complementary DNA has been generated from the original single-stranded mRNA, standard polymerase chain reaction, termed the \"second strand reaction,\" is initiated. If the initial mRNA templates were derived from the same tissue, subsequent PCR reactions can be used to probe the cDNA library that was created by reverse transcription. Primers can be designed to amplify target genes being expressed in the source tissue. Quantitative real-time PCR can then be used to compare levels of gene expression. - A thermostable DNA polymerase and the upstream and downstream DNA", "be present in the preparation; it must be purified away or enzymatically degraded. Two DNA primers that specifically match the mRNA of interest are added, along with reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase, and the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates needed for DNA synthesis. The first round of synthesis is the reverse transcription of the RNA into DNA using one of the primers. Next, a series of heating and cooling cycles allows the amplification of that DNA strand by PCR (see Figure 8\u201336). The quantitative part of this method relies on a direct relationship between the rate at which the PCR product is generated and the original concentration of the mRNA species of interest.

For highly structured RNA targets, especially common in viral genomes, it would be advantageous to perform the cDNA synthesis reactions at higher temperatures so that RNA secondary structures are destabilized and non-specific primer binding is minimized. The use of the two-enzyme systems has other inherent disadvantages. For example, the separate reverse transcription step delays the results by up to 30 min, low temperature DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of the reverse transcriptase can catalyze non-specific primer extension products that compete for and limit sensitivity of RT-PCR, and there is evidence that the RT and the Pol can compete for the template, resulting in efficiency anomalies especially apparent when detecting limiting amounts of target.", "of reverse transcription represent elongation of a DNA primer. We demonstrate that the polymerase fidelity of RT enzymes is significantly higher in tRNA-primed reverse transcription compared with DNA-primed reactions. Two mechanistic explanations can be proposed. First, the type of template-primer (T- P) duplex (RNA-RNA versus RNA-DNA) may affect the RT enzyme conformation such that the discrimination against incorrect nucleotides is affected. Second, the tRNA primer may act as a fidelity co-factor through specific association with the RT enzyme. According to the latter hypothesis, the increased fidelity observed for an RNA-RNA T-P should persist at a distance from the initiation site, where the enzyme-bound nucleic acid duplex will consist of RNA-cDNA. However, we measured that the effect of tRNA on the fidelity is detectable only at a short distance", "reverse transcriptase domain of the Pol protein.

The HWP states the population will have the given genotypic frequencies (called Hardy-Weinberg proportions) after a single generation of random mating within the population.

Assortative mating, which causes an increase in homozygosity only for those genes involved in the trait that is assortatively mated (and genes in linkage disequilibrium with them).

While neither of the first two assumptions is a good description of human population history, study of this idealized case reveals the general principles in a clear and simple way. When a new neutral mutation occurs in a population of constant size N that is undergoing random mating, the probability that it will ultimately become fixed is approximately 1/(2N). This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations.

Since null alleles are a technical problem and sampling effects that occur during mating are a real biological property of a population, it is often very important to distinguish between them if excess homozygotes are observed. When using microsatellites to compare species, homologous loci may be easily amplified in related species, but the number of loci that amplify successfully during PCR may decrease with increased genetic distance between the species in question.

The conditional model is most appropriate when the sample size per generation is large either in an absolute sense or in relation to the total population size. Minimum chi-square and the unconditional likelihood are most appropriate when the population size is effectively infinite and the samples are small. Both models", "and how the distributions change over time. Changes in the frequency of an allele in a population can be influenced by natural selection, where a given allele's higher rate of survival and reproduction causes it to become more frequent in the population over time. Genetic drift can also occur, where chance events lead to random changes in allele frequency. Over many generations, the genomes of organisms can change, resulting in the phenomenon of evolution. Mutations and the selection for beneficial mutations can cause a species to evolve into forms that better survive their environment, a process called adaptation.

The answer to this question depends on the functional consequences of the mutation. If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors.

Heterochromatin also replicates later in S phase of the cell cycle than euchromatin, and is found only in eukaryotes. Both centromeres and telomeres are heterochromatic, as is the Barr body of the second inactivated X chromosome in a female. # Function Heterochromatin is believed to serve several functions, from gene regulation to the protection of the integrity of chromosomes; all of these roles can be attributed to the dense packing of DNA, which makes it less accessible to protein factors that bind DNA or its associated factors. For example, naked double-stranded DNA ends would usually be interpreted by the cell as damaged DNA, triggering cell cycle arrest and DNA repair.

Regions of DNA that exist as constitutive heterochromatin are the same for all cells of a given species.

Replication timing has been indirectly linked to chromosome architecture since the 1960s, when it was discovered that the inactive X chromosome in female mammals takes on a compact structure localized to the periphery of the nucleus, known as the Barr body, which is coincident with a switch to late replication. As discussed, DNA replication takes place in spatially distinct compartments of the nucleus at different times during S phase, and it is now generally appreciated that facultative heterochromatin, including silent gene families (genes that lack poised polymerase II) and imprinted gene loci, are late replicating and generally localized closer to the nuclear periphery or nucleoli. Recently, a compelling genome-wide alignment was found between replication timing and the density of", "expressed.

In most organisms, constitutive heterochromatin occurs around the chromosome centromere and near telomeres. # Facultative heterochromatin Facultative heterochromatin The regions of DNA packaged in facultative heterochromatin will not be consistent within the cell types of a species, and thus a sequence in one cell that is packaged in facultative heterochromatin (and the genes within poorly expressed) may be packaged in euchromatin in another cell (and the genes within no longer silenced).

This and other features suggest that the F element is packaged as heterochromatin throughout. F element genes have distinct characteristics (e.g, low codon bias, and larger size due both to larger introns and an increased number of exons), but exhibit expression levels comparable to genes found in euchromatin. Mapping experiments show the presence of appropriate chromatin modifications for the formation of DNaseI hypersensitive sites and transcript initiation at the 5' ends of active genes, but, in most cases, high levels of heterochromatin proteins are observed over the body of these genes. These various features raise many interesting questions about the relationships of chromatin structures with gene and chromosome function.

However, recent research suggests that the Barr body may be more biologically active than was previously supposed. ## Genes ## Number of genes The following are some of the gene count estimates of human X chromosome. Because researchers use different approaches to genome annotation their predictions of the number of genes on each chromosome varies (for technical details, see gene prediction).

Now that the genetic material of the virus is incorporated and has become part of the genetic material of the host cell, it can be said that the host cell is now modified to contain a new gene.

Even though their amino acid sequences can vary greatly, the signal sequences of proteins having the same destination are functionally interchangeable; physical properties, such as hydrophobicity, often seem to be more important in the signal-recognition process than the exact amino acid sequence. Signal sequences are recognized by complementary sorting receptors that guide proteins to their appropriate destination, where the receptors unload their cargo.

This view is implied in the typical experimental paradigm for studying song learning, in which the bird is isolated in a sound-proof chamber and exposed only to tape-recorded song. This paradigm remains the major method of studying song learning despite recent demonstrations of the importance of social variables, and it contains the implicit assumption that non-auditory variables, especially social and ecological variables, play only a", "and females learn to sing and learn to combine their songs into temporally coordinated joint displays, could provide many insights into the processes by which vocal learning takes place.

Thus no matter how much an enzyme speeds up a reaction, it cannot change its direction. Despite the above limitation, enzymes steer all of the reactions in cells through specific reaction paths. This is because enzymes are both highly selective and very precise, usually catalyzing only one particular reaction. In other words, each enzyme selectively lowers the activation energy of only one of the several possible chemical reactions that its bound substrate molecules could undergo. In this way, sets of enzymes can direct each of the many different molecules in a cell along a particular reaction pathway (Figure 2\u201324).

The rate of an enzyme reaction (V) increases as the substrate concentration increases until a maximum value (Vmax) is reached. At this point all substrate-binding sites on the enzyme molecules are fully occupied, and the rate of reaction is limited by the rate of the catalytic process on the enzyme surface. For most enzymes, the concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half-maximal (Km) is a measure of how tightly the substrate is bound, with a large value of Km corresponding to weak binding. WHY", "rate of reaction is determined by the number of such energized molecules. In general, the lower the Ea, the more molecules have sufficient energy to pass through the transition state and, therefore, the faster the rate of the reaction. 3. Alternate reaction pathway: An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower Ea (see Fig. 5.4). The enzyme does not change the free energies of the reactants (substrates) or products and, therefore, does not change the equilibrium of the reaction (see p. 70). It does, however, accelerate the rate by which equilibrium is reached. B.

Enzymes achieve extremely high rates of chemical reaction\u2014rates that are far higher than for any synthetic catalysts. There are several reasons for this efficiency.

The idea is advanced that an evolutionary pressure in the direction of increased metabolic fluxes should lead to the selection at any evolutionary stage of enzymes which are optimally efficient considering the total evolutionary effort which has been spent on their improvement as catalysts. Relationships are derived which may be used for determination of the optimal state of operation of a Michaelian enzyme at a given total evolutionary effort as measured, for instance, by the mean magnitude of variable rate constants in the reaction mechanism.

Across years, the fitness pay-offs of the two strategies were approximately equal: females who never parasitized (a 'pure cooperative' strategy) laid larger clutches and fledged more young from their own nests than did birds that both nested and parasitized (a 'mixed' strategy).

Mammals have evolved a dosage compensation mechanism to equalize the dosage of X-chromosome gene products between males and females. The correct ratio of X chromosome to auto-some (non-sex chromosome) gene products is carefully controlled, and mutations that interfere with this dosage compensation are generally lethal. Mammals achieve dosage compensation by the transcriptional inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in female somatic cells, a process known as X-inactivation.

Once either Xp or Xm has been inactivated, it remains silent throughout all subsequent cell divisions of that cell and its progeny, indicating that the inactive state is faithfully maintained through many cycles of DNA replication and mitosis.

The fact that this new life has half the genes of each parent is one reason for the Mendelian laws.

The chromosomal number, 46, is found in most of the somatic cells of the body and is called the diploid (2n) number.

However, in theory predation can favor similar patterns. This theory premises that predators increase their search intensity with increasing density of prey.

Similarly, selection can be defined to act only on the phenotype of one life stage (as opposed to both) to represent that a reduced phase, such as the sporophyte in bryophytes, does not interact strongly with the environment, or to represent different kinds of selection pressures, such", "fern phylum Pteridophyta are also sometimes referred to as pteridophytes. # Life cycle Ferns are vascular plants differing from the more primitive lycophytes by having true leaves (megaphylls), and they differ from seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) in their mode of reproduction - lacking flowers and seeds. Like all other vascular plants, they have a life cycle referred to as alternation of generations, characterized by a diploid sporophytic and a haploid gametophytic phase. Unlike the gymnosperms and angiosperms, the ferns' gametophyte is a free-living organism. The life cycle of a typical fern is as follows: - A sporophyte (diploid) phase produces haploid spores by meiosis; - A spore grows by mitosis into a gametophyte, which typically consists of a photosynthetic prothallus - The gametophyte produces gametes (often both", "The resurgence of haploids in higher plants. The life cycle of plants proceeds via alternating generations of sporophytes and gametophytes. The dominant and most obvious life form of higher plants is the free-living sporophyte. The sporophyte is the product of fertilization of male and female gametes and contains a set of chromosomes from each parent; its genomic constitution is 2n. Chromosome reduction at meiosis means cells of the gametophytes carry half the sporophytic complement of chromosomes (n). Plant haploid research began with the discovery that sporophytes can be produced in higher plants carrying the gametic chromosome number (n instead of 2n) and that their chromosome number can subsequently be doubled up by colchicine treatment. Recent technological innovations, greater understanding of underlying control mechanisms and an expansion of end-user", "Sporophyte All land plants, and some algae, have life cycles in which a haploid gametophyte generation alternates with a diploid sporophyte, the generation of a plant or alga that has a double set of chromosomes. A multicellular sporophyte generation or phase is present in the life cycle of all land plants and in some green algae. For common flowering plants (Angiosperms), the sporophyte generation comprises almost their whole life cycle (i.e. whole green plant, roots etc), except phases of small reproductive structures (pollen and ovule). # Overview The sporophyte produces spores (hence the name), by meiosis. These meiospores develop into a gametophyte. Both the spores and the resulting gametophyte are haploid, meaning they only have one set of homologous chromosomes. The mature gametophyte produces male or female gametes", "(thallus (tissue) or plant), which is genetically haploid, and a sporophyte (thallus or plant), which is genetically diploid. A haploid plant of the gametophyte generation produces gametes by mitosis. Two gametes (originating from different organisms of the same species or from the same organism) combine to produce a zygote, which develops into a diploid plant of the sporophyte generation. This sporophyte produces spores by meiosis, which germinate and develop into a gametophyte of the next generation. This cycle, from gametophyte to gametophyte, is the way in which all land plants and many algae undergo sexual reproduction. # Distinctions It is often stated that the distinction of \"free-living\" is important, because all sexually reproducing organisms can be thought to involve alternating phases, at least at the cellular level as", "# Distinctions It is often stated that the distinction of \"free-living\" is important, because all sexually reproducing organisms can be thought to involve alternating phases, at least at the cellular level as meiosis. However, alternation of generations implies that both the diploid and haploid stages are multicellular and this is more important than \"free-living\" . Such a distinction changes the concept to one separating animals and plants. The gametophyte and sporophyte are usually separate, independent organisms in basal algae such as Ulva lactuca, where the gametes are free-swimming, and the zygote is formed in the water. By contrast, in land plants the sporophytes are to a greater or lesser extent dependent on the gametophytes, and vice-versa, especially in the gymnosperms and angiosperms. Indeed it is a defining characteristic", "Selection on the gametophyte: Modeling alternation of generations in plants. Selecting appropriate parameter values for genetic simulations can be challenging. In fact, even obtaining realistic ranges for parameter values from empirical studies in the literature proved surprisingly difficult, underscoring the need for more population demographic studies in plants. The proportions of sporophytes to gametophytes, archegonia to antheridia, females to males, and megasporangia to microsporangia can all vary substantially (Appendix S2). Modeling every aspect of these life cycles at a realistic scale is unfeasible (for example, thousands of sperm are produced by each monoicous gametophyte), and is redundant when many individuals are mitotically identical. A goal of this work was thus to identify the parameters that are likely to most strongly influence evolutionary outcomes, and to design efficient simulations", "Selection on the gametophyte: Modeling alternation of generations in plants. This has important implications, as it is generally assumed that most adaptations caused by strong positive selection will occur during the dominant life stage of an organism. In bryophytes, this could lead to the expectation that selective sweeps will be common, because the dominant phase is haploid, and indeed, both bryophyte models exhibited stronger sweeps at the haploid\u2010affecting gene region. By contrast, pteridophytes may be expected to experience softer selective sweeps, because selection is more likely to act on the sporophyte stage, where dominance effects occur. This expectation, however, is overly simplistic, as demonstrated by simulations performed under more realistic model parameterizations, which led to substantially greater variation in genome\u2010wide patterns of genetic diversity than were observed between", "contrast, the proposal is made that the sporophytes of homosporous plants are indeed sexual reproductive organisms, as are the gametophytes of heterosporous plants. This view requires the expansion of the number of sexual reproductive states we accept for these plant species; therefore, a three-sex model for homosporous plants and a four-sex model for heterosporous plants are described and then contrasted with the current two-sex model. These new models allow the use of sexual reproductive terms in a manner largely similar to that seen in animals, and may better accommodate the plant alternation of generations life cycle than does the current plant two-sex model.

The emerging consensus in the field is that the thick and thin filaments play complementary, cooperative roles in regulating contractility in vertebrate striated muscles. Under physiological conditions, the binding of Ca2+ to troponin is the obligatory initial step in the activation of contraction, while the matching of force and speed of contraction to the demands placed upon a muscle appears to involve an array of thin or thick filament\u2013linked mechanisms. At present, it appears that increaseding the load on a contracting muscle disrupts the interacting head motif that is characteristic of inactive (or super-relaxed) myosin, freeing these myosin heads to interact with actin and increase the force of contraction as a means to bear the load. This is a", "lines represents the sarcomere, which is the contractile unit of the muscle cell. The thin filaments are composed of actin, tropomyosin, and troponin and extend into the A band. The A band is composed of thick filaments, along with some overlap of thin filaments. The thick filaments are composed of myosin and extend from the center of the sarcomere toward the Z lines. Myosin filaments are formed by a tail-to-tail association of myosin molecules in the center of the sarcomere, followed by a head-to-tail association as the thick filament extends toward the Z lines. Thus the myosin filament is polarized and poised for pulling the actin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. A cross-section view of the sarcomere near the end of the A band shows that", "Tropomyosin movement is described by a quantitative high-resolution model of X-ray diffraction of contracting muscle. Contraction of skeletal and cardiac muscle is controlled by Ca2+ ions via regulatory proteins, troponin (Tn) and tropomyosin (Tpm) associated with the thin actin filaments in sarcomeres. In the absence of Ca2+, Tn-C binds actin and shifts the Tpm strand to a position where it blocks myosin binding to actin, keeping muscle relaxed. According to the three-state model (McKillop and Geeves Biophys J 65:693-701, 1993), upon Ca2+ binding to Tn, Tpm rotates about the filament axis to a 'closed state' where some myosin heads can bind actin. Upon strong binding of myosin heads to actin, Tpm rotates further to an 'open' position where neighboring actin monomers also become available for myosin binding. Azimuthal", "new actin molecule. The myosin head is again tightly bound to a new actin molecule of the thin filament (rigor configuration), and the cycle can repeat. Although an individual myosin head may detach from the thin filament during the cycle, other myosin heads in the same thick filament will attach to actin molecules, thereby resulting in movement. Because the myosin heads are arranged as mirror images on either side of the H band (antiparallel arrangement), this action pulls the thin filaments into the A band, thus shortening the sarcomere. Regulation of contraction involves Ca2, sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the transverse tubular system. Ca2 must be available for the reaction between actin and myosin. After contraction, Ca2 must be removed. This rapid delivery and removal of Ca2 is accomplished by", "The position of tropomyosin in muscle thin filaments. The contraction of vertebrate skeletal muscle is controlled by the action of Ca2+ on muscle thin filaments. At low Ca2+ concentrations (less than 10(-6)M) the regulatory proteins of the thin filament, tropomyosin and troponin, relax muscle by preventing the interaction of myosin and actin. At higher Ca2+ levels this inhibition is removed, when Ca2+ binds to troponin. Tropomyosin, a long coiled-coil alpha-helical molecule, is located in each of the two long-pitch helical grooves of actin, but troponin, a globular molecule, is attached at intervals of 38 nm (refs 1, 2). By combining evidence from X-ray diffraction studies of muscle and from electron microscopy, several authors have proposed that tropomyosin moves to block or allow attachment of myosin heads to actin.", "Tropomyosin # Overview Tropomyosin, along with troponin, regulates the shortening of the muscle protein filaments actin and myosin. In resting muscle fibres, tropomyosin is displaced from its normal binding groove by troponin. This displaced conformation of tropomyosin prevents the binding of myosin heads, thereby inhibiting muscle contraction. Under normal stimulation to muscle fibers, Ca2+ ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the myocytes which causes troponin to release its hold on actin, allowing tropomyosin to return to a normal conformation which allows myosin heads to walk along actin filaments and thereby facilitating muscle contraction. # Functional Characteristics ## Sliding filament theory Tropomyosin is an alpha helical coiled coil protein dimer that binds end to end along F actin filaments in striated muscle.

Tropomyosin blocks myosin binding and hence crossbridge cycling in the absence of Ca2+ and the muscle Ca2+ regulatory element troponin. Ca2+ influx from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle myocytes binds to troponin and subsequently moves tropomyosin on the F-actin filament exposing the myosin binding sites. Recent structural visualization and kinetic modeling has suggested that myosin binding further moves tropomyosin on actin to a fully open state allowing for uninhibited crossbridge cycling as the muscle contracts.

A choice experiment questionnaire was developed and applied in the Varna Bay area to assess the extent to which the quantity of algal blooms and the duration of", "historically low in comparison to other similar estuaries and this suggests that reductions in nutrient delivery into the Bay may have an important impact on pelagic production and recreational yield, particularly for pelagic species.

According to the competitive exclusion principle, only a small number of plankton species should be able to coexist on these resources. Nevertheless, large numbers of plankton species coexist within small regions of open sea. # Paradoxical traits A partial solution to the paradox lies in raising the dimensionality of the system.

At the highest level are those that inhabit the zone that is only wetted by the tops of sea spray, the deepest living are those that are attached to the sea-bed under several meters of water.

Bacterial metabolism is classified on the basis of three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration. Carbon metabolism in bacteria is either heterotrophic, where organic carbon compounds are used as carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide.

Calcium ions are responsible for many important physiological functions, such as in muscle contraction. It is normally bound to intracellular components even though a secondary messenger is a plasma membrane receptor. Calcium regulates the protein calmodulin, and, when bound to calmodulin, it produces an alpha helical structure. This is also important in muscle contraction. The enzyme phospholipase C produces diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate, which increases calcium ion permeability into the membrane. Active G-protein open up calcium channels to let calcium ions enter the plasma membrane. The other product of phospholipase C, diacylglycerol, activates protein kinase C, which assists in the activation of cAMP(another second messenger). # Examples", "acetylcholine and histamine.

Other drugs produce vasodilation by inhibiting specific phosphodiesterases, thereby interfering with the metabolic breakdown of cGMP. One such drug is sildenafil, used in treating erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension (see Chapter 12). The calcium-phosphoinositide and cAMP signaling pathways oppose one another in some cells and are complementary in others.

This signal is called the \"secondary messenger.\" (The neurotransmitter is the first messenger.)

Receptors respond to a bound ligand by initiating a series of reactions that ultimately result in specific intracellular responses. Second messenger molecules, so named because they intervene between the original extracellular messenger (the neurotransmitter or hormone) and the ultimate intracellular effect, are part of the cascade of events that converts (transduces) ligand binding into a response.

SE is also a versatile model to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of plant embryo patterning. The morphology and molecular regulation of SE resemble those of zygotic embryogenesis and begin with establishment of apical-basal asymmetry. The apical domain, the embryo proper, proliferates and eventually gives rise to the plantlet, while the basal part, the embryo suspensor, is terminally differentiated and gradually removed via vacuolar programmed cell death (PCD). This", "Embryonic Development in Arabidopsis Thaliana: From the Zygote Division to the Shoot Meristem. The apical half of the globular embryo becomes partitioned into two lateral organ primordia and a central stripe that develops into the shoot meristem. Kaplan and Cooke propose that initiation of cotyledons is equivalent to initiation of leaves and thus that the apical domain of the embryo constitutes the first shoot meristem. However, with the discovery of stem cell regulators, the emerging picture is that many components of a self-maintaining meristem are still missing in the globular embryo. This suggests that cotyledon initiation, albeit morphologically similar to postembryonic leaf initiation, uses a different genetic repertoire than the postembryonic shoot meristem.", "the basal/lower tier embryo domain (LT), which will contribute to the hypocotyl, RAM, and parts of the cotyledons. The BC divides transversely, generating a filament of seven to nine cells by the globular stage of EP development, giving the extraembryonic suspensor (S), with the exception of the uppermost cell that contributes to the root meristem through the formation of the hypophysis (Figure 1). The suspensor connects the pro-embryo to maternal tissue and provides nutrients and growth factors as well as pushing the developing embryo into the nutrient-rich endosperm].", "of flowering plants the zygotes first division is transversely orientated in regards to the long axis and this establishes the polarity of the embryo. The upper or chalazal pole becomes the main area of growth of the embryo, while the lower or micropylar pole produces the stalk-like suspensor that attaches to the micropyle. The suspensor absorbs and manufacturers nutrients from the endosperm that are utilized during the embryos growth. The embryo is composed of different parts; the epicotyle will grow into the shoot, the radicle grows into the primary root, the hypocotyl connects the epicotyle and the radicle, the cotyledons form the seed leaves, the testa or seed coat forms the outer covering of the seed. Monocotyledonous plants like corn, have other structures; instead of the hypocotyle-epicotyle, it", "general observation is sometimes summarized by the phrase \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" For example, the backbone is a common structure among all vertebrates such as fish, reptiles and mammals, and the backbone also appears as one of the earliest structures laid out in all vertebrate embryos. The cerebrum in humans, which is the most sophisticated part of the brain, develops last. This rule is not absolute, but it is recognized as being partly applicable to development of the human embryo. # Embryos of plants and animals - Plants: In botany, a seed plant embryo is part of a seed, consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves, stem (see hypocotyl), and root (see radicle), as well as one or more cotyledons.

Different primordial types like the leaf and flower primordia arise from the shoot apical meristem. The process is intricately regulated by a set of genes that affect the positioning, growth and differentiation of the primordium. The plant hormone Auxin has also been implicated in this process, with the new primordia being initiated at the site where the auxin concentration is the highest.", "a shell or hull, and the potato is a tuber. # Seed structure A typical seed includes three basic parts: (1) an embryo, (2) a supply of nutrients for the embryo, and (3) a seed coat. The embryo is an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. The radicle is the embryonic root. The plumule is the embryonic shoot. The embryonic stem above the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s) is the epicotyl. The embryonic stem below the point of attachment is the hypocotyl.

Germination rate is useful in calculating seed requirements for a given area or desired number of plants. ## Dicot germination The part of the plant that emerges from the seed first is the embryonic root, termed radicle or primary root. This allows the seedling to become anchored in the ground and start absorbing water. After the root absorbs water, the embryonic shoot emerges from the seed. The shoot comprises three main parts: the cotyledons (seed leaves), the section of shoot below the cotyledons (hypocotyl), and the section of shoot above the cotyledons (epicotyl). The way the shoot emerges differs between plant groups. ### Epigeous In epigeous (or epigeal) germination, the hypocotyl elongates and"]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_collegebiology", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

Eggs that distinguish between sperm haplotypes could provide a solution to this dilemma, allowing for the combination of the most compatible parental haplotypes. The ability of eggs to prefer complementary sperm haplotypes would thus provide a great evolutionary advantage even in nonpromiscuous mating systems (Eberhard 1996; Bernasconi et al. 2004; Otto et al. 2015), irrespective of whether it evolved before or after precopulatory", "characteristic of the species rather than of a few scattered individuals?

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

Recombination does not have any influence on the statistical probability that another offspring will have the same combination.

This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run.

As the nerve cell matures, these type III IFs are replaced by more complex type IV neurofilaments expanding the diameter of axons in order to attain normal velocities of action potentials.

Their existence was originally proposed by Spanish histologist Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal based upon stationary images he observed under the microscope.

The most crucial roles of the neuronal growth cone are to explore its surroundings ultimately establishing synaptic contacts. # Structure The morphology of the growth cone can be easily described by using the hand as an analogy.

The actin filaments depolymerize and disassamble on one end to allow free monomers to migrate to the leading edge of the actin filament where it can polymerize and thus reattach.

Reduced left-heart filling leads to a reduced stroke volume which manifests as a decrease in systolic blood pressure. The decrease in systolic blood pressure leads to a faster heart rate due to the baroreceptor reflex, which stimulates sympathetic outflow to the heart. # Mechanism of Reduced Blood Pressure During Inspiration in Pulsus Paradoxus A decrease in blood pressure and increase in pulse rate is normally", "change in cardiac output (Q) has an inverse-linear effect on venous and direct-linear effect on arterial pressure.

Some features of the Golgi are already well understood. Newly synthesized proteins move from the ER to the Golgi, where they are processed before being sorted to their ultimate destinations. This processing includes carbohydrate modifications and proteolytic cleavage events. The Golgi is often composed of disk-like membranes called cisternae, and early- and late-acting processing enzymes are concentrated in distinct cisternae. Golgi cisternae in higher eukaryotes are arranged in ordered stacks of 4\u20138 cisternae.

Whereas the majority of proteins pass through the Golgi on their way to other cell destinations, either by vesicular shuttles or through maturation of cisternae from the cis- to the trans-face, a number of membrane proteins reside in the different Golgi cisternae. Experimental evidence suggests that the length of the transmembrane domain is of crucial importance for the retention of proteins within the Golgi. In non-dividing cells, protein transport out of the Golgi is either directed towards the plasma membrane/cell wall (secretion) or to the vacuolar system. The latter comprises the lytic vacuole and protein storage vacuoles. In general, transport to either of these from the Golgi depends on different sorting signals and receptors and is mediated by clathrin-coated and", "Cisternae # Overview A cisterna (plural cisternae) comprises a flattened membrane disk that makes up the Golgi apparatus. A typical Golgi has anywhere from 3 to 7 cisternae stacked upon each other like a stack of dinner plates, but there are usually around 6. The cisternae carry Golgi enzymes to help or to modify cargo proteins traveling through them destined for other parts of the cell. The cisternae also carry structural proteins important for its maintenance as a flattened membrane and its stacking upon each other. The earliest cisternae are called the cis-cisternae, followed by the medial cisternae, then the trans-cisternae (as they move away from the endoplasmic reticulum). The formation of new cisternae is often called the cis-Golgi network and at the end of the Golgi where", "Evidence that the entire Golgi apparatus cycles in interphase HeLa cells. The Golgi apparatus occupies a central position within the secretory pathway and is located as a compact juxtanuclear structure in typical animal cells. It provides the organellar framework in which proteins and lipids that originate in the ER can undergo a series of posttranslational events including glycosylation and sorting. These events are ordered cis, medial to trans, entry to exit, across the stacked Golgi region membranes. Unlike the ER, the Golgi apparatus itself has no capacity to synthesize de novo either proteins or lipids. In a fundamental sense, the Golgi apparatus must be derived from the ER where the integral membrane components of the Golgi apparatus are synthesized. Evolutionarily, the Golgi apparatus may have originated as an", "transport mechanism which proteins use to progress through the Golgi apparatus is not yet clear; however a number of hypotheses currently exist. Until recently, the vesicular transport mechanism was favoured but now more evidence is coming to light to support cisternal maturation. The two proposed models may actually work in conjunction with each other, rather than being mutually exclusive. This is sometimes referred to as the combined model. - Cisternal maturation model: the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus move by being built at the cis face and destroyed at the trans face. Vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum fuse with each other to form a cisterna at the cis face, consequently this cisterna would appear to move through the Golgi stack when a new cisterna is formed at the", "Getting through the Golgi complex. Electron micrographs of the Golgi apparatus typically show a series of flat cisternae stacked together, surrounded by numerous vesicles and tubules. Palade and colleagues established in the 1960s that secretory proteins pass through this morphologically complex organelle as they travel from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. However, the precise mechanism of transport through the cisternal stack has proven a controversial issue.

The Golgi apparatus is integral in modifying, sorting, and packaging these substances for cell secretion (exocytosis) or for use within the cell. It primarily modifies proteins delivered from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, but is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell, and the creation of lysosomes. In this respect it can be thought of as similar to a post office; it packages and labels items and then sends them to different parts of the cell. Enzymes within the cisternae are able to modify substances by the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphate (phosphorylation) to them. In order to do so the Golgi transports substances such as nucleotide sugars into the organelle from the cytosol.

Based on an enormous body of anatomical and physiological work, the protective endodermal diffusion barrier is thought to be of major importance for many aspects of root biology, reaching from efficient water and nutrient transport to defense against soil-borne pathogens.

In a growing plant root, the inner vascular system is sealed off by an epithelium, the endodermis.

The role of the Casparian strip has been proposed to prevent backflow of water and nutrients into the soil, but as mutant plants lacking the Casparian strip only have weak phenotypes, the view that it serves an essential function in plants has been challenged. In an accompanying paper, it is shown that loss of the Casparian strip impacts the ability of the plant to take up ammonium and", "The endodermis, a tightly controlled barrier for nutrients. Plant roots acquire nutrients from the soil and transport them upwards to the aerial parts. To reach the central vasculature of the root, water and nutrients radially cross all external cell layers. The endodermis surrounds the vascular tissues and forms diffusion barriers. It thereby compartmentalizes the root and allows control of nutrient transport from the soil to the vasculature, as well as preventing backflow of nutrients from the stele. To achieve this role, endodermal cells undergo two specialized differentiations states consisting of deposition of two impermeable polymers in the cell wall: lignin, forming the Casparian strips, and suberin lamellae.

Structurally, the apoplast is formed by the continuum of cell walls of adjacent cells as well as the extracellular spaces, forming a tissue level compartment comparable to the symplast. The apoplastic route facilitates the transport of water and solutes across a tissue or organ. This process is known as apoplastic transport.

The fact that the loss of IRT1 polarity impairs the radial transport of iron and metals suggests that metals don't travel through the plant cell-cell communications called plasmodesmata to exit epidermal cells.

Because this group is deprotonated at alkaline pH, the rate of the reaction declines. 2. pH effect on enzyme denaturation: Extremes of pH can also lead to denaturation of the enzyme, because the structure of the catalytically active protein molecule depends on the ionic character of the amino acid side chains. 3. Variable pH optimum: The pH at which maximal enzyme activity is achieved is different for different enzymes and often reflects the [H+]", "Prediction of distal residue participation in enzyme catalysis. Many chemical reactions that require high temperature and/or extreme pH in the laboratory are catalyzed by enzymes at physiological temperature and neutral pH. One of the central challenges in biochemistry is to understand how enzymes achieve this catalytic power under mild conditions. Structural and biochemical studies have now characterized the active sites of hundreds of enzymes; nearly all of these studies have focused on the amino acid residues in direct contact with the reacting substrate molecule(s). A typical enzyme might consist of hundreds of residues, but only a handful of them have been identified in the literature as catalytically important. In the manually curated portion of the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA),a database of enzyme active site composition compiled from the", "and the corresponding enzyme-catalyzed rates for five enzymes. Rate accelerations range from 109 to 1023. Enzymes not only bind tightly to a transition state, they also contain precisely positioned atoms that alter the electron distributions in the atoms that participate directly in the making and breaking of covalent bonds. Peptide bonds, for example, can be hydrolyzed in the absence of an enzyme by exposing a polypeptide to either a strong acid or a strong base. Enzymes are unique, however, in being able to use acid and base catalysis simultaneously, because the rigid framework of the protein constrains the acidic and basic residues and prevents them from combining with each other, as they would do in solution (Figure 3\u201349). The fit between an enzyme and its substrate needs to", "energy for the reaction, and it is the major determinant of the reaction rate. Enzymes have a much higher affinity for the transition state of the substrate than they have for the stable form. rate of reaction Figure 3\u201346 enzyme kinetics. The rate of an enzyme reaction (V) increases as the substrate concentration increases until a maximum value (Vmax) is reached. At this point all substrate-binding sites on the enzyme molecules are fully occupied, and the rate of reaction is limited by the rate of the catalytic process on the enzyme surface. For most enzymes, the concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half-maximal (Km) is a measure of how tightly the substrate is bound, with a large value of Km corresponding to weak binding. WHY", "substrate that allows the reaction to proceed at one-half its maximum rate (0.5 Vmax) (see Figure 3\u201346). A low Km value means that the enzyme reaches its maximum catalytic rate at a low concentration of substrate and generally indicates that the enzyme binds to its substrate very tightly, whereas a high Km value corresponds to weak binding. The methods used to characterize enzymes in this way are explained in Panel 3\u20132 (pp. 142\u2013143). Enzymes achieve extremely high rates of chemical reaction\u2014rates that are far higher than for any synthetic catalysts. There are several reasons for this efficiency. First, when two molecules need to react, the enzyme greatly increases the local concentration of both of these substrate molecules at the catalytic site, holding them in the correct orientation for", "number of substrate molecules having sufficient energy to pass over the energy barrier and form the products of the reaction. 2. Velocity decrease with higher temperature: Further elevation of the temperature causes a decrease in reaction velocity as a result of temperature-induced denaturation of the enzyme (see Fig. 5.7). The optimum temperature for most human enzymes is between 35\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Human enzymes start to denature (see p. 20) at temperatures above 40\u00b0C, but thermophilic bacteria found in hot springs have optimum temperatures of 70\u00b0C.

X. CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "reaction section contains the substrate and the product of the reaction (both with CAS number and name), the enzyme classification (EC) number of the reaction and the reaction type. The activity section can cover one of following types: conversion activity, enatiomeric excess or inhibition. All three types are followed by the corresponding kinetic values and the experimental conditions. The provided standards for kinetic data necessitate a minimum quality of biochemical protein data (e.g enzyme activity provided in \u00b5mol product made by \u00b5mol enzyme per minute).", "methods of measuring the concentrations of substrates and products exist and many enzymes can be assayed in several different ways. Biochemists usually study enzyme-catalysed reactions using four types of experiments: (1) Initial rate experiments. When an enzyme is mixed with a large excess of the substrate, the enzyme-substrate intermediate builds up in a fast initial transient. Then the reaction achieves a steady-state kinetics in which enzyme substrate intermediates remains approximately constant over time and the reaction rate changes relatively slowly. Rates are measured for a short period after the attainment of the quasi-steady state, typically by monitoring the accumulation of product with time. Because the measurements are carried out for a very short period and because of the large excess of substrate, the approximation free substrate is approximately", "efficiency. First, when two molecules need to react, the enzyme greatly increases the local concentration of both of these substrate molecules at the catalytic site, holding them in the correct orientation for the reaction that is to follow. More importantly, however, some of the binding energy contributes directly to the catalysis. Substrate molecules must pass through a series of intermediate states of altered geometry and electron distribution before they form the ultimate products of the reaction. The free energy required to attain the most unstable intermediate state, called the transition state, is known as the activation energy for the reaction, and it is the major determinant of the reaction rate.

In monoecious spermatophytes (Figures 4E and 5C) and dioecious spermatophytes (Figure 4F), the sporophyte produces specialized reproductive structures (e.g., cones in gymnosperms, flowers in angiosperms). In angiosperms, the flowers have a pistil (consisting of a stigma, style, and ovary) and/or stamens (consisting of an anther and filament).

Often, individuals must secure resources that are essential for mating (nests, territories, food), and then after securing a resource, individuals engage in competition for access to limited opposite sex mates and gametes. A large body of empirical research and some verbal models have illustrated that resource acquisition can influence sexual selection.

As a result, sexual body size dimorphism is a general rule in polygynous artiodactyls and is correlated with the degree of polygyny. Sex differences in body size lead to differences in energy requirements and food selection between the sexes.

I show that the transition is not feasible under biologically relevant conditions in any of these models. Then, I show that the transition can happen if one accounts for male heterogeneity, assortative pair formation, and evolution of female choice and faithfulness. This process is started when low-ranked males begin using an alternative strategy of female provisioning.

This is because the trait\u2019s benefits in terms of reproduction outweigh its disadvantages in terms of survival.

However, resource limitation, in terms of nutritional limitations, can affect males' ability to produce sperm (or ejaculate as a whole), given that they are energetically costly and such situation of resource limitation is expected to be common.

C4 photosynthesis is an improvement over the classical C3 carbon acquisition, which evolved more than 50 times independently in at least 18 flowering plant families (;. In the C4 pathway, atmospheric CO2 is fixed in the mesophyll cells by the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). The resulting four-carbon acids are then transformed and transported into the bundle\u2013sheath layer cells, where their decarboxylation releases CO2 for the Calvin\u2013Benson cycle. This creates a CO2 pump that, by concentrating CO2 around Rubisco, decreases photorespiration rates and is thus beneficial, especially under high air temperature and low CO2 concentrations (;. Despite being overall convergent, the C4 photosynthetic trait greatly varies among plant taxa, both anatomically and biochemically (;;. Three different C4 biochemical", "in which they approximated the CO2 concentration-dependent changes in rubisco's v ratio by modelling two rubisco populations in the bundle sheath cells \u2014 the native rubisco, which performs both carboxylation and oxygenation at a typical C3 plant ratio of 3 : 1 [], and a carbon-concentration mechanism-dependent rubisco population which only catalyzed the carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and used exclusively CO2 released in the bundle sheath cells. Using this setup, they tested several scenarios and found that high photorespiration and N limitation drove the emergence of C4 flux patterns in the model. The model also predicted that light availability and distribution across the leaf section, i.e. between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells could play a role in the evolutionary choices of possible decarboxylation enzymes NAD-ME, NADP-ME, and PEP-carboxykinase.", "in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis involves the fixation of CO2 by the enzyme RuBisCo into 3-phosphoglycerate. However, due to the dual carboxylase / oxygenase activity of RuBisCo, an amount of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy, in what is known as photorespiration. In order to bypass the photorespiration pathway , C4 plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver CO2 to the RuBisCO enzyme. They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well. Instead of direct fixation in the Calvin cycle, CO2 is converted to a 4-carbon organic acid which has the ability to regenerate CO2", "[C4 type photosynthesis]. C4 photosynthesis includes several anatomical and biochemical modifications that allow plants to concentrate CO2 at the site of Rubisco. The photorespiratory pathway is repressed in C4 plants, since the rates of photosynthesis and biomass production are increased. This is an adaptation to high light intensities, high temperatures and dryness. C4 plants contain two distinct types of photosynthetic cells, mesophyll and bundle sheath. The processes of assimilation and reduction of CO2 are separated spatiality and catayzed by two different enzymes. Only the bundle sheath chloroplasts perform the reactions of the Calvin-Benson cycle with the help of the Rubisco enzyme present exclusively in this cell type. The primary CO2 fixation occurs in mesophyll cells through the action of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The light-dependent reactions of the photosynthesis", "the inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms of C4 and CAM plants. The others are NADP-malic enzyme and NAD-malic enzyme. In C4 carbon fixation, carbon dioxide is first fixed by combination with phosphoenolpyruvate to form oxaloacetate in the mesophyll. In PEPCK-type C4 plants the oxaloacetate is then converted to aspartate, which travels to the bundle sheath. In the bundle sheath cells, aspartate is converted back to oxaloacetate. PEPCK decarboxylates the bundle sheath oxaloacetate, releasing carbon dioxide, which is then fixed by the enzyme Rubisco. For each molecule of carbon dioxide produced by PEPCK, a molecule of ATP is consumed. PEPCK acts in plants that undergo C4 carbon fixation, where its action has been localized to the cytosol, in contrast to mammals, where it has been found that PEPCK works in", "Spatial resolution of an integrated C4+CAM photosynthetic metabolism. Last, we performed alternative modeling scenarios related to C4 anatomy. We revised the constraint of CO2-proof bundle sheath cells (typical C4 anatomy) by allowing CO2 to diffuse into bundle sheath but maintained the same atmospheric CO2 as in modeling scenarios with CO2-impermeable bundle sheath. To set a CAM scenario, we set daytime CO2 at 0 and the RuBisCO carboxylation\u2013to\u2013oxygenation ratio to 5.15, following (). All the other settings and constraints were the same for C3, C4, and CAM scenarios.

They also have a different leaf anatomy than C4 plants. They grab the CO2 at night when their stomata are open, and they release it into the leaves during the day to increase their photosynthetic rate. C4 metabolism physically separates CO2 fixation from the Calvin cycle, while CAM metabolism temporally separates CO2 fixation from the Calvin cycle. # Discovery Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 1800s.

In the early evolution of life, cyanobacteria overcame a major obstacle in devising a way to use solar energy to split water and fix carbon dioxide.

Finally, we", "Salt gland The salt gland is an organ for excreting excess salt. It is found in elasmobranchs, marine birds, and some reptiles. In sharks, salt glands are found in the rectum, but in birds and reptiles, they are found in the skull, in the area of the eyes or nostrils. Such glands work by active transport via sodium-potassium pump that moves salt from the blood into the gland, where it can be excreted as a concentrated solution. Salt glands function to keep salt balance, and allow marine reptiles to drink seawater. The need for salt glands in reptiles and birds stems from the fact that their kidneys are much less efficient than those of mammals. Unlike the skin of amphibians, reptile and bird skin is impermeable to salt,", "[Extrarenal salt excretion in oceanic birds]. Oceanic birds feed mainly on marine invertebrates which are isosmotic with sea water. The kidneys of birds have a low concentrating ability and are unable to produce urine with a sodium concentration more than 300mmol/l. How do these birds avoid dehydration? The excess salt is eliminated by the secretory work of a paired gland in the head known for centuries to anatomists as nasal glands or supraorbitary glands, and now that their function is elucidated called salt excreting glands or simply salt glands. They connect through a duct with the nasal cavity. Oceanic birds expel by the nares a clear and colourless watery liquid that contains primarily Na(+) and Cl(-), at high and constant concentration, with a small amount of K(+) and", "tubular sodium Na uptake of birds with competent salt glands. Relative to body mass, kidney mass and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are greater in birds with salt glands than in birds that do not have them. Birds with salt glands do not change GFR, when they drink saline. Thus, their renal filtrate contains excess Na that is, in some species, almost completely renally reabsorbed and excreted in a more concentrated salt gland secretion. Na reabsorption by kidneys of other species, like mallards is less complete and their salt glands make less concentrated secretion. Such species may reflux urine into the hindgut, where additional Na may also be reabsorbed for extrarenal secretion. During exposure to saline, marine birds maintain elevated aldosterone levels despite high Na intake. Marine birds are", "## Excretory Excretion is performed mainly by two small kidneys. In diapsids uric acid is the main nitrogenous waste product; turtles, like mammals, mainly excrete urea. Unlike the kidneys of mammals and birds, reptile kidneys are unable to produce liquid urine more concentrated than their body fluid. This is because they lack a specialized structure present in the nephrons of birds and mammals, called a Loop of Henle. Because of this, many reptiles use the colon to aid in the reabsorption of water. Some are also able to take up water stored in the bladder. Excess salts are also excreted by nasal and lingual salt-glands in some reptiles. ## Nervous The reptilian nervous system contains the same basic part of the amphibian brain, but the reptile cerebrum and", "low or water losses increase, the kidneys conserve water by producing a small volume of urine that is hyperosmotic with respect to plasma. When water intake is high, a large volume of hypoosmotic urine is produced. In a normal individual, urine osmolality (Uosm) can vary from approximately 50 to 1200 mOsm/kg H2O, and the corresponding urine volume can vary from approximately 18 L/day to 0.5 L/day. Importantly the kidneys can regulate excretion of water separately from excretion of total solute ( Fig. 35.1 ). The ability to regulate water excretion separate from excretion of solutes (e.g., Na+ , K+ , urea, etc.) is necessary for survival because it allows water balance to be achieved without upsetting the other homeostatic functions of the kidneys. It is important to recognize", "the urea cycle. Despite the generalization above, the pathway has been documented not only in mammals and amphibians, but in many other organisms as well, including birds, invertebrates, insects, plants, yeast, fungi, and even microorganisms. Urea is essentially a waste product, but is vital for forming hypertonic (concentrated) urine. In the distal portions of the kidney collecting duct, urea is reintroduced into the kidney medulla to raise osmolarity. Afterwards, water flowing through the collecting tubule flows back into the body by osmosis through aquaporins. Urea is dissolved in blood (in humans in a concentration of 2.5 - 7.5 mmol/liter) and excreted by the kidney in the urine. In addition, a small amount of urea is excreted (along with sodium chloride and water) in human sweat. # Hazards Urea", "of the kidneys to excrete water. How the kidney accomplishes this is discussed in detail in the following sections of this chapter. Renal Mechanisms for Dilution and Concentration of Urine As already noted, water excretion is regulated separately from solute excretion. For this to occur the kidneys must be able to excrete urine that is either hypoosmotic or hyper-osmotic with respect to body fluids. This ability to excrete urine of varying osmolality in turn requires that solute be separated from water at some point along the nephron. As discussed in , reabsorption of solute in the proximal tubule results in reabsorption of a proportional amount of water. Hence solute and water are not separated in this portion of the nephron. Moreover, this proportionality between proximal tubule water and", "in reptiles and birds stems from the fact that their kidneys are much less efficient than those of mammals. Unlike the skin of amphibians, reptile and bird skin is impermeable to salt, meaning that the transition to a tougher skin meant a loss in salt-releasing ability. The evolution of a salt gland would have allowed early reptiles and birds to eat aquatic plants and animals, who have high salt concentrations. This does not, however, explain the evolution of the gland in the elasmobranchs, suggesting convergent evolution. Some theories suggest that mammalian tear ducts and sweat glands may be evolutionarily related to salt glands.

However the selective mechanisms driving patterns of SSD remain controversial. 'Rensch's rule' proposes a general scaling phenomenon for all taxa, whereby SSD increases with average body size when males are larger than females, and decreases with body size when females are larger than males.

However, if all things are not equal, a parent may engage in discriminative investment towards one sex or the other, depending on the parent's condition. Additional middle-level evolutionary theories used in EP include: - The Trivers-Willard hypothesis, which proposes that parents should invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment.

CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that lack of conformity with Rensch\u00b4s rule in ground squirrels may be attributed to their low variation in SSD, and briefly discuss three potential causes of small magnitude of SSD in the structural size in rodents: low selection on SSD in structural dimensions, ontogenetic and genetic constraints and the existence of ecological/selection factors preventing the evolution of extensive SSD.", "10\u201314 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as K-selection (few offspring) and r-selection (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by evolution depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population. ## Other types of reproductive strategies Polycyclic animals reproduce intermittently throughout their lives.

Selection refers to the process by which environmental conditions \"select\" organisms with the appropriate traits to survive; these organisms will have such traits more strongly represented in the next generation. This is the basis of adaptive evolution. Darwin's great claim was that this \"natural selection\" was creative - it could lead to new traits and even new species, it was centred on individual survival, and it could explain the broad scale patterns of evolution. Many traits that are selected for can actually hinder survival of the organism while", "Evolutionary balancing of fitness-limiting factors. Debates concerning the roles of different factors that may limit an organism's reproductive success pervade evolutionary ecology. We suggest that a broad class of limiting-factors problems involving essential resources or essential components of reproductive effort can be analyzed with an evolutionary application of Liebig's law of the minimum. We explore life-history evolution using the metaphor of an organism that must harvest two essential resources (resources 1 and 2) from a stochastically varying environment. Our models make three predictions. First, organisms should overinvest, relative to the deterministic case, in harvesting the resource whose per-offspring harvest cost is smaller. Second, at the optimum, organisms balance multiple fitness-limiting factors rather than being consistently limited by one factor. Third, the optimal investment in harvesting a resource is", "The distribution of beneficial and fixed mutation fitness effects close to an optimum. The distribution of the selection coefficients of beneficial mutations is pivotal to the study of the adaptive process, both at the organismal level (theories of adaptation) and at the gene level (molecular evolution).

However, this prediction could be inaccurate under selection for an optimum (because fitness effect distributions have a finite right tail in this case). In this article, we derive the distribution of beneficial mutation effects under a general model of stabilizing selection, with arbitrary selective and mutational covariance between a finite set of traits.

But what is fitness and how can one tell when a trait enhances fitness, or more to the point, when one organism is fitter than another? Opponents of the theory of natural selection have long claimed that the theory is so treated by its proponents as to define fitness in terms of rates of reproduction, thus condemning the principle of the survival of the fittest to triviality: the claim that those organisms with higher rates of reproduction leave more offspring is an empty, unfalsifiable tautology bereft of explanatory power.

The dominant, pre-Hamiltonian view was that altruism evolved via group selection: the notion that altruism evolved for the benefit of the group. The problem with this was that if one organism in a group incurred any fitness costs on itself for the benefit of others in the group, (i.e. acted \"altruistically\"), then that organism would reduce its own ability to survive and/or reproduce, therefore reducing its chances of passing on its altruistic traits. Furthermore, the organism that benefited from that altruistic act and only acted on behalf of its own fitness would increase its own chance of survival and/or reproduction, thus increasing its chances of", "Scaling the risk landscape drives optimal life-history strategies and the evolution of grazing.

(3) It is an all-or-none response, which means that a stimulus normally either produces a full-sized action potential or fails to produce one. This all-or-none nature is in contrast both to the graded nature of the passive and local responses described previously and to synaptic responses (see Ionic Basis of Action", "over a range of stimulus intensities near threshold for detecting a response. An abrupt increase in the mean peak amplitude of synaptic currents was observed when the stimulus intensity was further increased. This all or none behaviour and the constant latency and shape of individual synaptic responses over time let us assume that only a single fibre was stimulated.

Note the higher amplitude of the second peak. Spatial summation refers to the fact that synaptic potentials generated by different synapses can interact. For example, in Fig. 6.8 , suppose axon 1 and 3 each fire an action potential but at widely separated times. Each produces an EPSP that depolarizes the cell but is too small to reach threshold (see Fig. 6.8C , EPSP1, EPSP3).

The technique used to amplify the signal is called signal averaging. The stimulus in each evoked potential test is applied many times (one or two thousand times), and since everything else besides the evoked potential is not related to the signal, it happens at various random times relative to the stimulus, whereas the potential that is evoked by the stimulus always occurs at the same time relative to", "under appropriate conditions.

The over-all time distribution has been checked by reconstructing mass action potentials from the calculations and comparing these with those observed.3.

Seasonal developmental plasticity, which consists of season-dependent alternations of developmental processes, has evolved to produce optimal phenotypes depending on specific periods in a year. For example, many phenological events in plants, such as flowering, fruiting, bud blast, bud formation, and growth cessation, are often controlled seasonally. Although temperature and photoperiod are the two major seasonal cues for such responses, the importance of phase lag between annual oscillations of the two signals has been unexplored, despite its universal nature in the context of seasonal environments. In this article, the phase-lag calendar hypothesis (New Phytologist, 210, 2016, 399), especially the one between temperature and photoperiod, is explained using meteorological data obtained from central Japan as an example.

As in many other organisms, plants rely on circadian clocks, endogenous self-sustained molecular oscillators, to keep track of time and to generate biological rhythms that occur on a daily basis []. Additionally, clock function allows flowering plants to estimate the most appropriate time of year to flower, thus favoring their reproductive success. For this, the plant clock needs to be reset (or synchronized) to the external day/night cycles. This process implies the perception of fluctuations in day length (photoperiod) and temperature, and subsequent transmission of such environmental information through specific \u2018input pathways\u2019 to the clock. Three major classes of photoreceptors are known to mediate light-input signaling to the clock in the model plant Arabidopsis: blue light (BL) receptors of the ZEITLUPE (ZTL)", "plant has to take account of both past and present conditions.

To sense this, the plant uses its circadian clock\u2014an endogenous 24-hour rhythm of gene expression\u2014to generate a signal for flowering only when there is light for the appropriate part of the day. The clock itself is influenced by light, and the plant in effect uses the clock to compare past to present lighting conditions. Important parts of the genetic circuitry underlying these phenomena have been identified, including the phytochromes and cryptochromes that act as light receptors (discussed in Chapter 15). The flowering signal that is carried from the leaves to the stem cells via the vasculature depends on the product of Flowering locus T (Ft).

Flowering involves a transformation of the behavior of the cells at the growing apex of the plant shoot\u2014the apical meristem. During ordinary vegetative growth, these cells behave as stem cells, generating a steady succession of new leaves and new segments of stalk. In flowering, the meristem cells switch to making the components of a flower, with its sepals and petals, its stamens carrying pollen, and its ovary containing the female gametes. To time the switch correctly, the plant has to take account of both past and present conditions. One important cue, for many plants, is day length.

In many cell types, gene expression is governed by circadian clocks, in which delayed negative feedback produces 24-hour oscillations in the activities of transcription regulators, anticipating the cell's changing needs during the day and night.

Plant cells communicate to coordinate their activities in response to the changing conditions of light, dark, and temperature, which guide the plant\u2019s cycle of growth, flowering, and fruiting.

Annuals tend to produce many more seeds per plant since they will die at the end of the growing season, while perennials are not under the same pressure to produce large numbers of seeds but can produce seeds over many years. In warmer and more favorable climates, perennials grow continuously. In seasonal climates, their growth is limited to the growing season. For example, in temperate regions a perennial plant may grow and bloom during the warm part of the year, with the foliage dying back in the winter. These plants are deciduous perennials. Regrowth is from existing stem tissue. In many parts of the world, seasonality is expressed as wet and dry periods", "(discussed in Chapter 15).

This transmembrane movement of H+ has two major consequences: 1. It generates a pH gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, with a high pH in the matrix (close to 8) and a lower pH in the intermembrane space.

Together, \u2206pH and \u2206V make up the electrochemical gradient, which is measured in units of millivolts (mV).

The pollen tube typically contains one pair of sperm cells that are linked with a thin cytoplasmic bridge and delivered towards the so-called receptive synergid]. There are several important implications associated with the number of male gametes delivered. First, flowering plants are characterized by double fertilization, i.e. not only the egg cell but also the adjacent central cell, which is the precursor of the endosperm, gets fertilized by one sperm. The paired delivery of sperm cells enables an almost synchronized fertilization of both female gametes [], and a coordinated start of egg and central cell into seed development. This is particularly important, as embryo and endosperm development can be initiated in both female gametes independently of one another, which is evidenced e.g. by fertilization experiments", "Fertilization and early seed formation. The double fertilization of flowering plants is a complex process, encompassing multiple steps. From its discovery more than a century ago, many useful descriptive approaches have been employed to better unveil specific steps/mechanisms. More recently, the development of an in vitro assay developed in our laboratory, has allowed a better understanding of this phenomenon. However, in vitro methods may show some limitations. The search for complementary strategies, especially with the search of mutants affected in the fertilization step allowed one to elucidate this critical and unique phenomenon in living organisms.

Despite the generalization above, the pathway has been documented not only in mammals and amphibians, but in many other organisms as well, including birds, invertebrates, insects, plants, yeast, fungi, and even microorganisms. Urea is essentially a waste product, but is vital for forming hypertonic (concentrated) urine. In the distal portions of the kidney collecting duct, urea is reintroduced into the kidney medulla to raise osmolarity. Afterwards, water flowing through the collecting tubule flows back into the body by osmosis through aquaporins. Urea is dissolved in blood (in humans in a concentration of 2.5 - 7.5 mmol/liter) and excreted by the kidney in the urine. In addition, a small amount of urea is excreted (along with sodium chloride and water) in human sweat. # Hazards Urea", "and urinary bladder concentrates unwanted solutes for excretion while minimizing renal water loss. In aglomerular fish, NaCl-coupled water secretion across proximal tubules replaces glomerular filtration to increase renal excretory capacity. A review of the literature suggests that tubular secretion of NaCl and water is an early function of the vertebrate proximal tubule that has been retained throughout evolution. Active transepithelial Cl secretion takes place in gall bladders studied as models of the mammalian proximal tubule and in proximal tubules of amphibians and apparently also of mammals.

Colonisation of desert regions became possible in birds and mammals due to development of the system of urine osmotic concentration.

Kidneys play an essential role in fluid-ion balance, but the mechanisms of renal handling of water vary depending on structural organization of kidneys and the environment. Fishes and amphibians in a hypoosmotic environment excrete excess water by forming dilute urine, whereas terrestrial tetrapods require water conservation by the kidney for survival. Diluting segments operated by a luminal Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter coupled with a basolateral Na(+)-K(+) pump are essential in forming dilute urine. In birds and mammals, the diluting segment that has the same transport characteristics now serves, with the development of additional architectural organization, for countercurrent urine concentration and water conservation.

The loop of Henle, in particular the thick ascending limb, is the major site where solute and water are separated.

Deterministic exclusions reduce both patch-scale richness and beta-diversity, thereby homogenising the community.

When these three criteria are satisfied those variants that are the most successful in the production of descendants (that is, the fittest ones) eventually come to dominate a population.

The modern synthesis of evolutionary biology unified Darwin's natural selection with Mendelian genetics, but at the same time it created the dilemma of genetic load. Lewontin and Hubby's (1966) and Harris's (1966) characterization of genetic variation in natural populations increased the apparent burden of this load. Neutrality or near neutrality of genetic variation was one mechanism proposed for the revealed excessive genetic variation. Bruce Wallace coined the term \"soft selection\" to describe an alternative way for natural selection to operate that was consistent with observed variation. He envisioned nature as presenting ecological vacancies that could be filled by diverse genotypes. Survival and successful reproduction was a combined function of population density, genotype, and", "The genetics and evolution of female choice. Darwin based his theory of evolution on the central theme of 'the struggle for existence', 'the preservation of favoured races', 'the survival of the fittest'. In addition to this 'natural selection', he proposed a second type of selection, sexual selection. 'This depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between males for possession of the females; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Males would compete for females, and females would choose between males. Since Darwin's work, many examples of natural selection have been observed in nature and in laboratory experiments, and knowledge of genetics has given natural selective theory a sound basis.

The second shows that at a population genetic equilibrium, individuals have the same behaviour as they would at an economic equilibrium, in which individuals are assumed to maximise a common utility function. The third proposition shows that if the common utility function fulfils certain conditions, the attainment of an economic equilibrium brings about the same behaviour as a population genetic equilibrium. This suggests a way in which evolutionarily stable behaviour can be brought about without the necessity for changes in gene frequencies.

In the context of evolution, probability plays a role in all three of the principles mentioned earlier, but particularly selection and inheritance (Tibell and Harms, unpublished data). For example, fertilization in sexual reproduction involves probabilistic events like the choice of mate. The best-adapted individuals are most likely to survive to reproductive maturity, mate, and thus to reproduce. Hence, the frequencies of organisms with given traits in a given environment depend on many random events, and the process of selection can also be defined as the probabilities of individuals with differing traits in a given population surviving and", "Evolvability Evolvability is a concept within the Darwinian understanding of biological evolution. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection requires that plants, animals, and other organisms be able to produce offspring that are sometimes better adapted to the circumstances of life than the parents are. It is these offspring that survive and reproduce, and the adaptive traits thus increase in number if they are passed down to the offspring. If the only changes to be found in offspring were deleterious, adaptive evolution could not occur. So, the ability to produce enough advantageous variation to allow adaptive evolution to occur is what is called \"evolvability\".

Most plant communities consist of several or many species which compete for light, water, and nutrients. Species in a given community may be ranked by their relative success in competition; productivity seems to be the best measure of their success or importance in the community. Curves of decreasing productivity connect the few most important species (the dominants) with a larger number of species of intermediate importance (whose number primarily determines the community's diversity or richness in species) and a smaller number of rare species. These curves are of varied forms and are believed to express different patterns of competition and niche differentiation in communities. It is probably", "The commonness of rarity: Global and future distribution of rarity across land plants. We tested several long-standing hypotheses concerning the processes creating and maintaining large-scale patterns of commonness and rarity. Specifically, we assessed whether the number of observed rare species follows predictions from biodiversity theory by comparing several proposed statistical distributions for the gSAD. First, we assessed two contrasting sets of predictions for the distribution of commonness and rarity of species (Fig. 2). Specifically, at increasingly larger geographic scales, both the unified neutral theory of biogeography (UNTB) () and the k-niche model () predict that the gSAD will converge on Fisher\u2019s log-series distribution ()where is the expected number of species, n is the total number of observations per species, \u03b1 is the diversity parameter, and x is a", "Community evolution increases plant productivity at low diversity. Species extinctions from local communities negatively affect ecosystem functioning. Ecological mechanisms underlying these impacts are well studied, but the role of evolutionary processes is rarely assessed. Using a long-term field experiment, we tested whether natural selection in plant communities increased biodiversity effects on productivity. We re-assembled communities with 8-year co-selection history adjacent to communities with identical species composition but no history of co-selection ('na\u00efve communities'). Monocultures, and in particular mixtures of two to four co-selected species, were more productive than their corresponding na\u00efve communities over 4 years in soils with or without co-selected microbial communities. At the highest diversity level of eight plant species, no such differences were observed.

Losses in efficiency of prediction were <1% if generalized models were used in place of species-specific models. Furthermore, application of generalized multispecies models did not introduce significant bias in biomass prediction in 92% of the 53 species tested. Further, overall efficiency of stand-level biomass prediction was 99%, with a mean absolute prediction error of only 13%. Hence, for cost-effective prediction of biomass across a wide range of stands, we recommend use of generic allometric models based on plant functional types. Development of new species-specific models is only warranted when gains in accuracy of stand-based predictions are relatively high (e.g. high-value monocultures)."]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_collegebiology", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

In most plant species, sucrose is the principal form of carbohydrate translocated through the veins from carbon-exporting source leaves to carbon-importing sink tissues. Maize (Zea mays) leaves contain two photosynthetic cell types, mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, that are concentrically arranged around the veins and co-operatively perform C4 carbon assimilation (;.

The study of the symplastic relations between the different cell types of the mature leaf showed that the density of the plasmodesmata is generally very low in comparison with other species investigated so far, particularly when considering the mesophyll/bundle sheath and the bundle sheath/phloem cells connections, as well as the connections of the transfer cell-sieve tube complex with the surrounding cells. These three successive barriers therefore strongly limit the possibilities of symplastic transit of the assimilates to the conducting cells. The comparison of the densities of plasmodesmata in an importing and an exporting leaf suggests that the maturation of the leaf is characterized by a marked symplastic isolation of the phloem, and, within the phloem itself, by the isolation of the conducting complex.

The confocal images showing movement of these fluorophores from xylem parenchyma through phloem parenchyma to the CC\u2013ST complexes unequivocally demonstrate the presence of a symplasmic pathway connecting these cells. Free space markers, in contrast, remain confined to the apoplasmic pathway, intercellular spaces, and cell walls, and their movement is, for the most part, along lignified walls.

Phloem parenchyma cells also contained 5,6-CF (see Fig. 5e for detail), but none was evident in the companion cells or the metaphloem sieve tubes (S) in images from this series of sections.

Some 5,6-CF fluorescence was seen occasionally outside the vascular bundle (Fig. 5b). Given that there are plasmodesmata along the interfaces from the vascular parenchyma through the bundle sheath and into the mesophyll, this result is not surprising as water diffuses rapidly and presumably can make use of the symplasmic pathway that exists from vascular parenchyma to the mesophyll. It is", "experiments demonstrate symplasmic connectivity rather than dynamic transport rates. Moreover, the reported low osmotic potential within, and the lack of interest of aphids in thick-walled sieve tubes, together with the low plasmodesmatal frequencies reported at the interface between vascular parenchyma and either thick-walled sieve tubes or companion cells, is further evidence that this is not a major assimilate accumulation pathway. Nevertheless, the retrieval of 5,6-CF by thick-walled sieve tubes, together with earlier results byshowing that the thick-walled sieve tubes in leaf blade veins of Zea are involved in [14C]sucrose retrieval by these sieve tubes, demonstrates a functional symplasmic pathway to thick-walled sieve tubes in grasses.", "A xylem sap retrieval pathway in rice leaf blades: evidence of a role for endocytosis?.
